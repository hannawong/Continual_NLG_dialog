Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? __eou__ Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! __eou__ I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . __eou__ Steven , I ... __eou__ I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . __eou__ What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? __eou__ When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . __eou__ What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . __eou__ I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! __eou__ Veronica , wait ! __eou__
Look out ! __eou__ What's it ? __eou__ You must have rolled over something just now . __eou__ What you said gives me the creeps ! __eou__
Er ... Alison ? __eou__ Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... __eou__ I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . __eou__ Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... __eou__ It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! __eou__ Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__ Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__ This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__ I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__ But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__ You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... __eou__
I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago . __eou__ But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... __eou__ I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . __eou__ This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . __eou__ I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . __eou__ The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . __eou__
I'm afraid I've spilt ink all over the table-cloth . __eou__ Oh , never mind about that . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry . Won't you let me pay for it ? __eou__ No , I won't hear of it . __eou__
Did you punch in ? __eou__ Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__ Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__ Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__ Sure , when those never ending meetings . __eou__
Hello , Dora , I haven't seen you for a long time . Where have you been ? __eou__ I didn ’ t go anywhere . I stayed at home . __eou__ What's up ? You look unhappy . __eou__ Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . __eou__ Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . __eou__ Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . __eou__ Thank you so much . You are so sweet . __eou__ Not at all . We are friends . __eou__
Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! __eou__ Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! __eou__ Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! __eou__ Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! __eou__ Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . __eou__ He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! __eou__ Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . __eou__ Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . __eou__ Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! __eou__ But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . __eou__ Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! __eou__ That would be great ! Give me a call ! __eou__ See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . __eou__
isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . __eou__ yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark __eou__ what's there after that ? __eou__ well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ what are all they for ? __eou__ most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__
Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! __eou__ Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . __eou__ Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! __eou__ Madam , patience is a virtue . __eou__ Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! __eou__ I'm sure a spot will open up soon . __eou__ Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__
Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . __eou__ I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? __eou__ Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . __eou__ But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . __eou__ I know why we have reservations . __eou__ I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . __eou__ But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . __eou__ Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? __eou__ Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . __eou__
wow , it that your sports car ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ when's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ it must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ what else is wrong with it ? __eou__ the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . __eou__ License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? __eou__ I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else . __eou__ Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? __eou__ Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all ! __eou__ Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? __eou__ Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole ! __eou__ You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ? __eou__ You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! __eou__
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__ I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__ You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__ That guy was definitely a Don . __eou__ So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . __eou__ Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . __eou__
The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! __eou__ I felt as if I had been in a different world . __eou__ And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . __eou__
Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . __eou__ Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . __eou__ Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . __eou__ No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . __eou__ Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . __eou__ It's a promise . __eou__
Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project . __eou__ Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around . __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! __eou__ Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . __eou__ What are you thinking of doing ? __eou__ I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . __eou__ There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit __eou__ Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . __eou__ Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . __eou__
You're spending a very long time on my hair . __eou__ I'm almost done . __eou__ I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . __eou__ I'm all done now . __eou__ Are you sure you're finished ? __eou__ I don't understand . __eou__ You did a horrible job on my hair . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ I don't like anything about it . __eou__ I apologize . __eou__ That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . __eou__ Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ? __eou__
That woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with her . __eou__
What courses are you taking ? __eou__ Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . __eou__ What do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! __eou__ That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? __eou__ Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . __eou__ What is he like ? __eou__ He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . __eou__ Are you able to follow him ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . __eou__ Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . __eou__ Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . __eou__
Would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? __eou__ Yes , With pleasure . __eou__
Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . __eou__ I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my sister , you know . __eou__
Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? __eou__ You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . __eou__ You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . __eou__ Did you hear the names he was calling me ? __eou__ I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? __eou__
Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? __eou__ I think a mountain village is splendid ! __eou__ I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . __eou__ It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . __eou__ I disagree , a big town is more lively . __eou__ But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! __eou__ Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . __eou__
When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . __eou__ You only need to tell me that once . __eou__
I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . __eou__ Calm down . __eou__
I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . __eou__ Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? __eou__ It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . __eou__ Why do you think that this would be a good move ? __eou__ I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . __eou__ Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . __eou__ Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . __eou__ I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . __eou__ Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . __eou__ I think you should definitely apply for the position . __eou__
She is so stupid . __eou__ Who cares ? She is pretty . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You're just jealous . __eou__
How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . __eou__ Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . __eou__ He's after your own heart , it is important . __eou__ So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . __eou__ I promise ! __eou__
You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . __eou__ Who was it ? __eou__ Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . __eou__ She never cares about others . __eou__ It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . __eou__ Her new boyfriend , right ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you know about that ? __eou__ I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! __eou__
I'm not satisfied with it . __eou__ Why not ? What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . __eou__ Would you like another one ? __eou__ No . Can I have my money back ? __eou__ Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? __eou__ A receipt ? __eou__ Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . __eou__ Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . __eou__
I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . __eou__ Are they coming to Chicago again ? __eou__ Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . __eou__ Oh , good ! We can all get together again . __eou__ I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . __eou__ And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . __eou__ Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . __eou__ I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . __eou__
hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? __eou__ oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . __eou__ what ' the matter ? __eou__ the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . __eou__ I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . __eou__ yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . __eou__ that's true . __eou__ anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? __eou__ it was good . I brough lunch from home today . __eou__ you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . __eou__ well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . __eou__ i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . __eou__ yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? __eou__ you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . __eou__ well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . __eou__ seriously ? __eou__ yeah , it's hard to believe but true . __eou__
Hurry up , get in . __eou__ I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! __eou__ OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! __eou__ Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! __eou__ Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! __eou__ Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! __eou__ What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__ Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__ I ’ m going as fast as I can ! __eou__ Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . __eou__ You ’ re such a geek ! __eou__
I don't think the lecture is very interesting . __eou__ The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__ I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care . __eou__
You ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__ Calm down . Madam . __eou__ I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__ I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . __eou__ Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? __eou__ I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . __eou__
I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day . __eou__ Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? __eou__ Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . __eou__ I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! __eou__ I think we can still talk . __eou__ No way ! Please don't follow me around . __eou__ Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . __eou__ Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . __eou__
Any chance of using your telephone ? __eou__ You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . __eou__ Well , I thought it was not that serious . __eou__
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . __eou__ How about the new bar across the road ? __eou__ Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . __eou__ I agree , I had lunch there last week . __eou__ Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__
I have a bone to pick with you . __eou__ Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? __eou__ You always have a chip on your shoulder . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . __eou__
How could you have done that without asking me first ? __eou__ I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . __eou__ Well , you should have thought . __eou__ I'm sorry . I'll ask next time . __eou__
Hey , sorry to be late . __eou__ What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . __eou__ My mother was ill . I had to look after her . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry to hear that . __eou__
What's happening in your life ? __eou__ Can you believe I'm going to America ? __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes , I'm really excited . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . __eou__ Well , they are very nice you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry I couldn't help you . __eou__
I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . __eou__ Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ It is in the park downtown . __eou__ Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ? __eou__ We will need it for Saturday only . __eou__ I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? __eou__ Mary and I will be driving the van . __eou__ Could you drop it off on Sunday night ? __eou__ Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? __eou__ Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night . __eou__
You're looking great . __eou__ You , too . __eou__
David , I ’ m going to China . __eou__ Really ? How do you get the chance ? __eou__ You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . __eou__ Congratulations . How lucky you are ! __eou__ Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . __eou__ I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . __eou__ I ’ m sure I will . __eou__ Have a nice journey , Lily . __eou__ Thank you , David . __eou__
did you get my email ? __eou__ I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ how did the business trip go ? __eou__ well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ no , should I have ? __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . __eou__ You've done a lot , my darling ! __eou__ I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . __eou__ You're too strict with yourself . __eou__ Perhaps . I'm dead tired . __eou__
You're my hero . __eou__ Aw , shucks , ma'am . __eou__
I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . __eou__ I'm not sure I can't agree , dan . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__ What are you talking about , we tried everything ! __eou__
David , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ I am not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh , I just can't forget it . __eou__
Your search on this project has been excellent . __eou__ Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team . __eou__ The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . __eou__ Well , I hope the client feels the same way ! __eou__ I am sure they will be pleased . __eou__
I want to try something different today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I want a different hair style . __eou__ What style do you want ? __eou__ Can you make my hair short ? __eou__ Exactly how short do you want it ? __eou__ Make it a few inches long . __eou__ Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for a while now . __eou__ Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . __eou__ I honestly want my hair that short . __eou__ All right , then let's begin . __eou__
Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . __eou__ But not as good as your mother's , right ? __eou__ Actually , it's better ... __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? __eou__ No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... __eou__ Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! __eou__ OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... __eou__
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__
The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__ No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__ If you say so ! __eou__
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
How's your new work , Carl ? __eou__ A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ Well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . __eou__
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I'm impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . __eou__
Can I borrow some money from you ? __eou__ No way ! __eou__
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . __eou__
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where it is ? __eou__ It's a private garden . __eou__
Would you like a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes . That would be good . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ This machine is out of order . __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order . __eou__
Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? __eou__ He has no sense . __eou__ If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money . __eou__ But Joe won't you . __eou__
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . __eou__ Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? __eou__ Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . __eou__
What's up ? You look low . __eou__ It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . __eou__ I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . __eou__ Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . __eou__
Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . __eou__ Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ He ’ s nearly 90 . __eou__ Good gracious ! Are you sure ? __eou__ I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . __eou__ Is she really ? __eou__ Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . __eou__ Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? __eou__
I am really impressed with your presentation skills . __eou__ Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . __eou__ Well , your time has been well spent ! __eou__ It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! __eou__
How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . __eou__
I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . __eou__ It ’ s great . __eou__
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . __eou__
That ’ s really a let-down . __eou__ Yeah . He really does let me down . __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . __eou__ I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . __eou__
Will you be done doing my hair soon ? __eou__ Give me a little while longer . __eou__ How much time do you need ? __eou__ There you go . How do you like it ? __eou__ I think it looks gorgeous . __eou__ You think it looks nice ? __eou__ I honestly think it looks great . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . __eou__ How much is it for my hair ? __eou__ Just give me $ 55 . __eou__ Thanks for doing such a good job . __eou__ No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time . __eou__
Do you have s second ? __eou__ Sure . What do you want ? __eou__ I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__ And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . __eou__ Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__
I am tired of everything in my life . __eou__ What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . __eou__ You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . __eou__ To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . __eou__ What did your boss say ? __eou__ He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! __eou__ That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__ That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . __eou__ Is your boss Chinese ? __eou__ No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . __eou__ That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? __eou__ That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . __eou__ Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! __eou__
Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes , please . That is very kind of you . __eou__ Shall I make more sandwiches ? __eou__ No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . __eou__
Guess what I've brought for you . __eou__ Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ So what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ How should I say it ? __eou__ I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . __eou__ It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ It was only the cheek . __eou__ That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ Oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ Definitely not . __eou__ You see , we still have hurdle . __eou__
Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! __eou__ I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . __eou__ What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . __eou__ I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . __eou__ All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! __eou__ Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! __eou__ Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . __eou__
hi , Lander . What's wrong ? __eou__ I can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__ the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . __eou__ is that inflation ? __eou__ inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . __eou__ has the government taken some measures to curb it ? __eou__ yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . __eou__ but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . __eou__ you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . __eou__ how ? __eou__ for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . __eou__ sounds a good idea . __eou__
Thanks for helping me up . __eou__ Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over ! __eou__ That takes talent ... __eou__ I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__
I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
I wish you would not be so selfish . __eou__ Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . __eou__ But you should at least consider your son's future . __eou__ His mother , not me , should do this . __eou__
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ The last straw , huh ? __eou__ Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . __eou__ His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__
I've had enough of that ! __eou__ Why , this is the most interesting film ! __eou__ I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . __eou__ But it's only a film . __eou__
I like the design of the coat . __eou__ But I like its color . __eou__ Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . __eou__ I'll take one , too . __eou__
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . __eou__
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ There's no need to apologize . __eou__ But I ruined your rug . __eou__ Forget it . It was an accident . __eou__
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! __eou__ Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? __eou__ I love fruit flavored ices the best . __eou__ I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . __eou__ What is your least favorite ice cream ? __eou__ I don't like peppermint ice cream . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . __eou__ One time , I tried garlic ice cream . __eou__ That could be interesting . __eou__ That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order ! __eou__
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! __eou__ So glad that you think so ! __eou__ I think you deserve a promotion . __eou__ Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . __eou__
Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . __eou__ OK , boy . I will buy it for you . __eou__
I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . __eou__ Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! __eou__ Don't worry . I can give you a lift . __eou__ Thank you . You save me . __eou__
Mary is really a diligent girl . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . __eou__ She is really something . __eou__
Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? __eou__ No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! __eou__ Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! __eou__ My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... __eou__ I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? __eou__
Where will you go in your vacation ? __eou__ Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation . __eou__ You're so industrious . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . __eou__ Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? __eou__ I'm not at all keen on this subject . __eou__
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? __eou__ That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? __eou__ It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . __eou__ Do you need it for the whole weekend ? __eou__ We will need it for both days . __eou__ We will need to know who will be driving the van . __eou__ The van will be driven by Mary and me . __eou__ It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? __eou__ Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . __eou__ Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ But a taxi costs too much . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . __eou__ You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . __eou__ Not often . Just when I make mistakes . __eou__
we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? __eou__ oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . __eou__ Jack ? __eou__ yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? __eou__ I will never go out with him anymore . __eou__ why did you say so ? __eou__ last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! __eou__ oh , really ? __eou__ he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . __eou__ are you kidding me ?

It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__ I can't think the same . __eou__ What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you . __eou__

I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do __eou__ That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 __eou__ But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . __eou__ The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . __eou__ When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . __eou__ Are you quite sure ? __eou__ Yes . Have a look . __eou__ I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . __eou__ Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . __eou__ Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? __eou__ Why am I always the last to know these things ? __eou__ I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? __eou__ No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . __eou__ How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . __eou__ He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! __eou__
I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help ! __eou__ What's up , Robert ? __eou__ Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ...

I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ?

We are going to have to let you go . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__ What ! I resent that ! __eou__ Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__
John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . __eou__ Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . __eou__ Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . __eou__ Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . __eou__ Would you like to clear the table then ? __eou__ Really ? Do I have to do it ? __eou__ Not , if you don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? __eou__ Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? __eou__ No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . __eou__
I always think everybody looks down on me __eou__ Don't be that negative . __eou__ How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . __eou__ I find it there is no meaning in living this world . __eou__ Don't be that negative . __eou__ Really , life is so boring . __eou__
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . __eou__
Listen to this . Mary got married . __eou__ Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ Yes . Yesterday . __eou__ Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! __eou__ She married Jerrod . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . __eou__ She ’ s going to live in Paris . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__
How do you get along with your co-workers ? __eou__ I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . __eou__ Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? __eou__ It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . __eou__ So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? __eou__ I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . __eou__ I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . __eou__
It ’ s really terrible ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? __eou__ Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . __eou__ You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . __eou__
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . __eou__ Birds of a feather flock together . __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ Come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
Joan is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps talking when I'm reading . __eou__ There must be something wrong with her . __eou__
Bother the flies ! __eou__ Where do they come from ? __eou__ I don't know . Something rotten here ? __eou__ I can't see it . __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Are you satisfied with the dishes ? __eou__ Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . __eou__ I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . __eou__ Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 __eou__ If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . __eou__ Great , I love hot food too . __eou__ Well , let's finish this great dinner first . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . __eou__ My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__ No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? __eou__ Yes , I have . But I have to wait . __eou__
You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . __eou__ Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . __eou__
On , darn . The grocery store is closed . __eou__ Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . __eou__ Alright . We are out of everything . __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . __eou__ I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . __eou__ Yeah , and the prices there are very high . __eou__ I know . Three dollars for milk . __eou__
I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . __eou__ Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . __eou__ She is a clever mother . __eou__
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty . __eou__
Did you see that ? __eou__ No , I missed it . __eou__ How could you miss that ? __eou__ Someone was in the way . __eou__
My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . __eou__ After all , he is a baby . __eou__ Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . __eou__
Are you ready to go to the mall ? __eou__ Yeah . Dig my new pants ? __eou__ Copycat ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ You went out and bought khakis , too ! __eou__ No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . __eou__ Whatever . __eou__
Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! __eou__ You have any idea why ? __eou__ She broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ I heard her boyfriend is married . __eou__ She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... __eou__ Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? __eou__ He sometimes really drives me crazy . __eou__
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__ You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . __eou__
What's the matter ? You don't look well . __eou__ I am worried . __eou__ What about ? __eou__ My exam . __eou__ Oh , is that all ? __eou__ I feel very nervous about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . __eou__ I'll teach you how to keep her . __eou__ Tell me , please . __eou__ After you've solved this problem for me . __eou__
One of my students told me she was very depressed today . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Her father is dying . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very sad . __eou__ Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__
He got the scholarship to Harvard . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ It's true . He is a hard worker . __eou__ I know he really deserves this . __eou__
Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! __eou__ Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? __eou__ I love anything with chocolate the best . __eou__ I like chocolate myself . __eou__ Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? __eou__ I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . __eou__ I haven't ever cared for that myself . __eou__ Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? __eou__ That sounds absolutely disgusting ! __eou__ It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? __eou__ You don ’ t love me , Roy . __eou__ Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . __eou__ No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . __eou__ Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . __eou__ I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . __eou__ Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . __eou__ Oh , shut up , Roy . __eou__ But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... __eou__ Oh , SHUT UP ! __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? __eou__ Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . __eou__ Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... __eou__ It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! __eou__ That's because it's time . __eou__ Time for what ? __eou__ It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... __eou__ You mean get married now ? On the plane ? __eou__ Why not ? I've got the rings ready . __eou__ I don't know what to say , Jack ! __eou__ Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... __eou__
Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! __eou__ I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! __eou__ But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! __eou__ Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__ What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__ Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . __eou__ My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__
Tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery . __eou__ He is really terrific ! __eou__ He was very clever when he was a boy . __eou__
What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? __eou__ Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . __eou__ I think they will . __eou__

I feel terrible . but ... __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ My daughter isn't feeling well . __eou__ Oh , no . Is it serious ? __eou__ I don't know . Will you forgive me ? __eou__ Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . __eou__ Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . __eou__ I could help you with that . __eou__ Are you sure you have the time ? __eou__ I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . __eou__ What would be the best time for you to help me ? __eou__ Tomorrow night would work for me . __eou__ Should we just meet here ? __eou__ OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ See you tomorrow night . __eou__
He has so many friends supporting him . __eou__ And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . __eou__ But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . __eou__

When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . __eou__ Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__ Maybe by then it will be too late . __eou__ What do you mean too late ? __eou__ By that time , you will be fired . __eou__
I've got a complaint about the noise next door . __eou__ Yes , it's most irritating . __eou__ Some people aren't very considerate . __eou__ We're going to do something about it . __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ We can't put up with it any more . __eou__ We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ What should we do ? __eou__ Why don't we call them ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
I don't think the lecture is very interesting . __eou__ The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__ I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__
Has the train come yet ? __eou__ No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . __eou__ It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . __eou__ Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! __eou__ Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! __eou__ Oh look ! Here it comes now ! __eou__
I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . __eou__ Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . __eou__
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . __eou__
You are not being a good sport about this . __eou__ That's because you cheated . __eou__ I never cheat . __eou__ Yes , you do . __eou__
I got a raise . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . __eou__

Isn ’ t it hideous ? __eou__ I guess . __eou__ Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . __eou__ And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__ Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__ Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__ And Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Merry Christmas ! __eou__
I'm so glad I bought this watch ! __eou__ Cool ! Flashy red lines ! __eou__ I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . __eou__ Is it waterproof ? __eou__ Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . __eou__ Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? __eou__ Well , surfing , scuba diving ... __eou__
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous ! __eou__
I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . __eou__ When are you going ? __eou__ Sometime next month . __eou__
Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? __eou__ Stay away from me . __eou__ Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? __eou__ I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__ That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . __eou__ Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . __eou__
Oh , my god ! __eou__ What ! __eou__ That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life ! __eou__ Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park . __eou__ What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross ! __eou__ South Park is a popular cartoon . You're so out of it , Jen __eou__ Well , don't blame me ! I never get a chance to watch TV . __eou__
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall I do ? __eou__ Call the police . __eou__
This is the best dinner I've ever had . __eou__ How about the soup ? __eou__ I've never tasted anything better . __eou__ How nice of you to say so . __eou__
Do you like our new history teacher ? __eou__ I'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__ You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__ I can't see it . __eou__
Excuse me , I wonder if you could help me ? __eou__ Of course , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . __eou__ Oh , what exactly is problem ? __eou__ Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that . __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . __eou__
Maybe we'd better go now . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__ Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . __eou__ Since we're late , let's go to see a film . __eou__ OK.Hurry up . __eou__
What a boring film ! __eou__ The acting of the heroine is too artificial . __eou__ And the plot is so simple . __eou__
your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta __eou__ would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . __eou__ this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . __eou__ cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? __eou__ ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? __eou__ sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . __eou__ that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? __eou__ that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__ fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . __eou__ you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? __eou__ I don't think it's broken . __eou__ well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! __eou__ fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . __eou__
what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . __eou__ I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ really ? I thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . __eou__ how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . __eou__ that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . __eou__ this is perfect ! What do you think ? __eou__ I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! __eou__ I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! __eou__
I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday . __eou__ Don ’ t think any more about it . __eou__ I must make an apology for losing my temper . __eou__ It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good . __eou__ I ’ m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ’ s my fault . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ The last straw , huh ? __eou__ Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__
Hey John . I have some great news . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I got a job offer from Dell . __eou__ That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . __eou__ I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . __eou__ I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . __eou__ Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
I really need a new pair of trousers . __eou__ Do you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . This one is very old now . __eou__ They look all right to me . __eou__ They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . __eou__ All right . All right . __eou__
Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! __eou__ Yes . I love it , too . __eou__ Who was the director ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . __eou__ What ? __eou__ She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . __eou__ What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? __eou__ Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . __eou__ Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! __eou__
If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . __eou__ Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . __eou__ No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . __eou__ That ’ d be fine . __eou__
It ’ s over . __eou__ What is over ? __eou__ Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... __eou__ Any reasons ? __eou__ The cause is another boy . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . __eou__
But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! __eou__ I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything ! __eou__ That stamp you've been looking for is for sale . __eou__ The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ? __eou__ Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . __eou__ Oh , that's all right . __eou__ I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__ No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that . __eou__

It is a little hot , but very good . __eou__ I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine . __eou__ Would you like another beer ? __eou__ I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me . __eou__ Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers ! __eou__ Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon . __eou__
Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . __eou__ Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . __eou__ So I'd rather walk or run to work . __eou__ You must be joking ! __eou__
Hi . __eou__ Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ You were playing it very late last night . __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ It kept me awake . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__ It kept me awake a couple of hours . __eou__ I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . __eou__ It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . __eou__ It's true.It was a bit loud . __eou__ I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . __eou__ Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . __eou__ I am glad we've straightened everything out . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? __eou__ It ’ s so cool ! __eou__
Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! __eou__ It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... __eou__ Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! __eou__ I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? __eou__ I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! __eou__
Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! __eou__ I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue . __eou__
What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . __eou__ But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . __eou__ I don't care ! __eou__ You're complaining again . __eou__
What he said disappointed me . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He advised me to change to a more suitable course . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . __eou__ It is stupid to say so . __eou__
just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . __eou__ It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . __eou__ This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! __eou__ What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? __eou__ I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . __eou__ But they are not as convenient as the subway . __eou__ You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . __eou__ Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . __eou__ I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? __eou__ What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . __eou__ Just throw them away ! __eou__
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in ? __eou__ Which room are you in ? __eou__ 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . __eou__ I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . __eou__ I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . __eou__
I was scared stiff of giving my first performance . __eou__ Were you ? your performance was excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your kindly words . __eou__
Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . __eou__
Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . __eou__ I just lost my job . My boss just told me . __eou__ That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? __eou__ I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . __eou__ I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . __eou__
The concert was really great . __eou__ I agree . __eou__ The singing group used to be very popular . __eou__ I can't believe they would play so good . __eou__
You are an eager beaver . __eou__ Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . __eou__ It's no use arguing the toss . __eou__ Maybe I'll have to face the music . __eou__
Jack , what's wrong ? __eou__ You ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? What did I do ? __eou__ You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? __eou__ No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__ She started feeling suspicious after you said that . __eou__ I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__ Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__ Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . __eou__ Don't bother . __eou__
My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help . __eou__ She does have a heart of gold . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time __eou__ Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . __eou__ Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? __eou__ I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__
My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . __eou__ Excuse me.What did you say ? __eou__ A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games __eou__ That's incredible . I cann't believe it . __eou__ You have to . It's sure . __eou__ How amazing ! __eou__
You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? __eou__ Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . __eou__ I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . __eou__
Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . __eou__ How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? __eou__ Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . __eou__
I have just had my new paper published . __eou__ You have done excellent work . __eou__ I'm going to Britain . __eou__ Really ? How did you get the chance ? __eou__ I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD . __eou__ My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University . __eou__ I really appreciate your kind words . __eou__
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__ By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . __eou__ Good , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? __eou__ Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! __eou__ Oh , do you really think so ? __eou__ Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . __eou__ But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . __eou__
Mary ? Are you still there ? __eou__ Yes . What do you want ? __eou__ Did your bid win ? __eou__ What do you care , dork ? __eou__ Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? __eou__ You mean fat boy ? __eou__ Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . __eou__
I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . __eou__ Don't worry yourself too much . __eou__ It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose it . __eou__
And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! __eou__ Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__ And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__ You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__ I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__ You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! __eou__
Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? __eou__ Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . __eou__ The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . __eou__ Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . __eou__ That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . __eou__ Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . __eou__ I'm really sick ! __eou__
I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . __eou__ Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__ Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__ Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ What were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__ Too bad . __eou__
Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? __eou__ No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... __eou__ It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats ? __eou__ No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... __eou__ Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? __eou__ You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . __eou__ Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . __eou__ Congratulations . That's great ! __eou__ I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . __eou__ When do you start ? __eou__ I start next Monday . __eou__ You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . __eou__ I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . __eou__ I bet . You must be stoked . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? __eou__ Sure . It's on you right ? __eou__ Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? __eou__ I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . __eou__ I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . __eou__
I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ? __eou__ Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . __eou__
I hate to see the abuse of animals . __eou__ It makes me sick . __eou__
Good morning , Loans . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence . __eou__ Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . __eou__ Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__
Are you Elvin ? __eou__ Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? __eou__ I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . __eou__ Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual . __eou__ It is ? __eou__ You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet . __eou__ I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . __eou__
i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . __eou__ what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? __eou__ not bad , any other ideas ? __eou__ well , there is a play on campus this weekend . __eou__ good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ what's the matter with these ideas ? __eou__ They are good , but i still need a few more . __eou__ what about going on a picnic ? __eou__ Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? __eou__ you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? __eou__ they are all good . __eou__
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ It must be Kate . __eou__ No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . __eou__ Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . __eou__ How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! __eou__ It spoiled my painting ! __eou__
My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . __eou__ What does his dad say ? __eou__ John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand . __eou__
She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . __eou__ She wears her heart on her sleeve . __eou__
Your ring is very beautiful . __eou__ Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . __eou__ Oh , it is precious . __eou__ It surely is . __eou__
So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
What is wrong with your face ? __eou__ My brother did it . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . __eou__
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
She's pretty and meek . __eou__ No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my wife , you know . __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . __eou__ Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . __eou__ Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . __eou__ Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . __eou__
I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike . __eou__ Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it . __eou__ I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . __eou__
It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . __eou__ Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . __eou__ I can't forget it . __eou__ You'd better cool yourself down first . __eou__
Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . __eou__ I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . __eou__
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ You're dancing so well . __eou__ You dance beautifully too . __eou__ When did you learn to dance ? __eou__ In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect . Couldn't be better ! __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I wanted . __eou__ No regrets ? __eou__ I'm really pleased with it . Thanks . __eou__ I'm glad you're so happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
I must admit I'm not at all interested in math . __eou__ I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it.It ' s such an interesting subject . __eou__ But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math . __eou__
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising __eou__
What's that ? __eou__ It's a surprise ! __eou__ For me ? __eou__ Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . __eou__ Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? __eou__ I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . __eou__ What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... __eou__
I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad . __eou__ He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . __eou__
This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . __eou__ Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . __eou__
Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . __eou__ Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . __eou__ Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . __eou__ Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . __eou__ You have much patience . __eou__ Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! __eou__ Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " __eou__ That's very nice . Is it for sale ? __eou__ No . I never sell my artwork . __eou__ Really ? Then what do you do with it ? __eou__ I give it away . Here , this one is for you . __eou__ Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! __eou__ Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... __eou__
Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . __eou__ Thank you . I was lucky this time . __eou__ I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . __eou__ I am flattered . __eou__ It is real word . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? __eou__ It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . __eou__ I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . __eou__ Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . __eou__
That guy's manner really turns me off . __eou__ Yeah.He never stops asking questions . __eou__ Maybe he's abnormal . __eou__
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ Yes , that would work out better . __eou__ You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . __eou__ Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! __eou__
You look really wiped out ? __eou__ I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__ Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all . __eou__ That was the straw that broke the camel's back . __eou__
That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? __eou__ Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? __eou__ Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . __eou__ Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again . __eou__
This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! __eou__ It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . __eou__ Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! __eou__ I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! __eou__ Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far ! __eou__ It ’ s fine . Jump in ! __eou__ Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! __eou__ Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! __eou__ It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . __eou__
Jane , what do think about this dinner ? __eou__ Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . __eou__
Would you go to the bookstore with me ? __eou__ It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . __eou__ Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? __eou__ Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . __eou__ So what are you interested in ? __eou__ Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . __eou__ I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . __eou__ Yes . I can lend you some . __eou__ Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . __eou__
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__ What a great idea ! __eou__ January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . __eou__ I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . __eou__ April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . __eou__ That is a good suggestion . __eou__ We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . __eou__ Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__ I'll put the survey online this afternoon . __eou__
How do you feel about the TV series ? __eou__ Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ But I don't think much of it . __eou__
Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down . __eou__ I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . __eou__ I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . __eou__ But my Rose is great . __eou__ Your Rose is a fool . __eou__ Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . __eou__ Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? __eou__
Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . __eou__ Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . __eou__
Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? __eou__ I like them very much . They are delicious . __eou__ Well , you can have all my carrots . __eou__ Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? __eou__ Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . __eou__ Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! __eou__ No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . __eou__ Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . __eou__ I know , but chocolate cake is even better . __eou__ Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . __eou__ Well , actually , I don't mind eating carrots , but chocolate cakes are much better . You know I was born with a sweet tooth . __eou__
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea ! __eou__
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__
It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . __eou__
Look what you've done ! __eou__ I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . __eou__ Yes , and hurry up ! __eou__ I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? __eou__ No , I'll do it myself . __eou__ Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? __eou__ I should think so , too ! __eou__ I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . __eou__ Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! __eou__ I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__
What's that ? __eou__ It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? __eou__ Is that Hello Kitty ? __eou__ Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! __eou__ Is it real gold ? __eou__ Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . __eou__
Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? __eou__ Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! __eou__ How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . __eou__ Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... __eou__ Look , it's starting ! __eou__ Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? __eou__
Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue . __eou__ I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ? __eou__ And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! __eou__ But you've been looking for that stamp for years . __eou__ It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . __eou__ Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck . __eou__ Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . __eou__
Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Well , Mr . King is singing . __eou__ Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? __eou__ He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . __eou__ And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? __eou__ She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . __eou__ What ’ s happening ? __eou__ The ladder ’ s falling ? __eou__ What ’ s Mr . King doing ? __eou__ He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . __eou__ And is she helping him ? __eou__ No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . __eou__
Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . __eou__ I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ It will be at the beach by the pier . __eou__ What day will you need it for ? __eou__ We will only be needing it for Sunday . __eou__ Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . __eou__ The only two drivers will be Mary and I . __eou__ If I give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? __eou__ Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ? __eou__ OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest . __eou__
Hi ! Wang Mei.Come and have a look at my new dress . __eou__ Oh ! What a beautiful dress ! It fits you so well.You look so charming in the dress . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ I bought it in a store near my school . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ It's only thirty yuan . __eou__ It's so cheap . I'll buy one , too . __eou__ I'll go together with you . __eou__
Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... I'll think about it . __eou__
Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! __eou__ Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo . __eou__ You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! __eou__ Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . __eou__ He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . __eou__
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not . He didn't have much time . __eou__ Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . __eou__ Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . __eou__ It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . __eou__ Can I see the rainbow ? __eou__ That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . __eou__
I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . __eou__
My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . __eou__ What scene ? __eou__ A kitten being run over by a truck . __eou__
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . __eou__ I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . __eou__ No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? __eou__ I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin . __eou__ Is it a two-pin socket ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . __eou__
It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . __eou__ Really ? There aren't many left now . __eou__ No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . __eou__ Were there any animals in the forest ? __eou__ Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . __eou__
Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . __eou__ Oh you ’ re so kind ! __eou__ Get in . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept __eou__ yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . __eou__
My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . __eou__ The early bird catches the worm . __eou__

I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . __eou__ Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ Good idea . That might help . __eou__
How are Zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ It'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . __eou__
I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . __eou__ He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . __eou__ Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! __eou__

This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__

Let's call it quits and go home . __eou__ See . Great minds think alike . __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__ It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__ So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__ Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__ No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . __eou__ I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . __eou__ I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . __eou__ What are we going to do now ? __eou__ I don't know . I feel like going out . __eou__ I wonder how much of the city is down . __eou__ It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . __eou__ Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__ I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . __eou__
I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . __eou__ I'm looking forward to it . __eou__
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__
Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? __eou__ Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . __eou__ You don't have to go right away . __eou__ I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . __eou__

Car trouble center . How may I help you ? __eou__ My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! __eou__ Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? __eou__ Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . __eou__ Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? __eou__ Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? __eou__ No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . __eou__ So what do you think it is ? __eou__ I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? __eou__ Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! __eou__
Bob , I'm really upset with you . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . __eou__ You forgot it last year as well . __eou__ I know , I'm sorry . __eou__
How much did you bid ? __eou__ Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! __eou__ We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! __eou__ But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . __eou__ What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? __eou__ You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . __eou__
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect ! Couldn't be better . __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I want . __eou__ No regrets . __eou__ I am really pleased with it . __eou__ I am glad you are happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . __eou__ Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? __eou__ He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . __eou__ But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? __eou__ Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . __eou__
Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . __eou__ Great ! This calls for a celebration . __eou__

Mom , have we got any cookies ? __eou__ Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . __eou__ I know , but I'm hungry . __eou__ Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? __eou__ Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I am telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__
You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . __eou__ I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . __eou__ You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . __eou__ Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . __eou__ That's where the shoe pinches . __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__ Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__ Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . __eou__
I don't want to do the damn dishes . __eou__ Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . __eou__

Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? __eou__ I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . __eou__ I hate to ask you to do something like that . __eou__ This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . __eou__ When could we get together ? __eou__ I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? __eou__ Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? __eou__ I'll come prepared . __eou__ Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet . __eou__
Is anything the matter , sir ? __eou__ Yes , it's my steak . __eou__ What's wrong with it , sir ? __eou__ It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . __eou__ I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? __eou__ Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . __eou__ I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef .

Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . __eou__ I always meet people like him . __eou__
Oh ! __eou__ What fools we were ! __eou__ To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . __eou__ And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . __eou__ What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . __eou__ I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . __eou__ I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? __eou__ And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . __eou__
Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye __eou__ Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . __eou__ I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ You are something else you know that ? __eou__
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__ But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__ I'll beat him . __eou__ So beat the cat , but don't kill it . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I am impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . __eou__
You seemed to be fed up with Mary . __eou__ Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks . __eou__ She is a barking dog . But she means well . __eou__ But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do . __eou__ You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . __eou__
Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . __eou__ Do you have the receipt with you ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Thank you . Do you want your money back ? __eou__ No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? __eou__ I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . __eou__ Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . __eou__
You're acting weird tonight . __eou__ I'm just in the mood to act goofy . __eou__ What brought this on ? __eou__ I guess I'm glad exams are over . __eou__
Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? __eou__ It's an excellent one . I like it very much . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__
Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . __eou__ Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . __eou__ It ’ s all right . __eou__ I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . __eou__ I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? __eou__ Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . __eou__ I totally understand . __eou__
What's taking you so long ? __eou__ Don't worry . I'm almost finished . __eou__ I need you to hurry up . __eou__ All right . I'm finished . __eou__ I think there's more you need to do . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ My hair looks awful . __eou__ What don't you like about it ? __eou__ I just don't like my hair . __eou__ I'm sorry that you don't like it . __eou__ I won't be paying you for this . __eou__ I'm sure we can work something out . __eou__
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ Stolen ? No , why ? __eou__ My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless . __eou__ I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . __eou__ He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too . __eou__ Didn't anyone stop them ? __eou__ You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . __eou__ That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__
I ’ m itching for moving ! __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? __eou__ It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . __eou__
Could you do me a favor ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Could you possibly give me a lift home ? __eou__ All right . __eou__ Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you . __eou__ No problem . I'd be happy to . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . __eou__
I am confused by what he said . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? __eou__ Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . __eou__
What are you thinking about ? __eou__ About my boyfriend . __eou__ Again ! __eou__ You are really a wet blanket . __eou__
You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go . __eou__
Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__ You are so thoughtful . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
what a nice uniform ! __eou__ thanks ; do you like it ? __eou__ not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? __eou__ yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . __eou__ they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? __eou__ I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . __eou__ so are you enjoying your new job ? __eou__ it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . __eou__ how do you like working in sales ? __eou__ I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . __eou__ that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . __eou__ yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! __eou__ I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! __eou__ how do you know her ? __eou__ she's my cousin . __eou__ why didn't you tell me about that before ? __eou__ I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . __eou__ well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . __eou__ that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . __eou__
Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ? __eou__ Sorry , I'll bring them to you right away . __eou__ Why is it taking so long ? __eou__ We are short of staff today . __eou__ There is something wrong with this dish . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ I don't think this is fresh . __eou__ They were delivered this morning . __eou__ Would you please ask the manager to come over ? __eou__
is everything alright ? __eou__ yes , everything is fine . __eou__ what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__ then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! __eou__ we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . __eou__ so where did you land ? __eou__ we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__ it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__ have you had anything to eat ? __eou__ I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? __eou__ I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! __eou__
Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message . __eou__ Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! __eou__ That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi . __eou__ Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? __eou__ Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . __eou__
You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . __eou__ I'm sorry . I won't do it again . __eou__ Try to be more careful in future . __eou__ I shall . I wasn't as careless as John Sampson . He walked across that wet cement over there . __eou__ The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . __eou__ The headmaster asked them not to do so . __eou__ Then why isn't there a notice ? __eou__ They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! __eou__ But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice ! __eou__
Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! __eou__ I got the short end of the stick . __eou__
the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . __eou__ that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ port , please . __eou__ excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . __eou__ the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? __eou__ yes . You always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . __eou__ oh , what's that ? __eou__ it's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ why not ? It sounds great . __eou__ oh , here's to your health . __eou__ thanks . Cheers . __eou__ cheers . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__ Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__ Well , I missed several buses . __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__ I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__ Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__ Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__ Have you got it now ? __eou__ Yes , I found it again . __eou__ When ? __eou__ This morning . I mean ... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation . __eou__
Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ really ? What happened ? __eou__ it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee __eou__ that's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ you know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
I'm afraid of the darkness . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll drive you back . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What happen , John ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Why do you look unhappy ? __eou__ I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
Excuse me . In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . __eou__ Is that right ? I didn't know it . __eou__ Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . __eou__ Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ? __eou__ We will keep and return it later . __eou__ Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? __eou__ You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . __eou__
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ There's no need to apologize . __eou__ But I ruined your rug . __eou__ Forget it . It was an accident . __eou__
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__
How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! __eou__ This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . __eou__ Yes , it's really savory . __eou__ Thank you for appreciating it . __eou__
I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . __eou__ 70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . __eou__
What a beautiful sweater ! __eou__ Do you think it looks good on me ? __eou__ Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . __eou__ You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . __eou__ I wish I could find one just like it . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? __eou__ Nothing particular . But , ... __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I , I don't know how to explain it to you . __eou__ Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . __eou__
Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . __eou__ Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
I'm tired of dancing . __eou__ But to me it's really enjoyable . __eou__ Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . __eou__ Maybe so . __eou__
I'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__ No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__ But she took her luggage away with her . __eou__ She will be back soon.You can wait and see . __eou__
I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? __eou__ What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . __eou__ I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . __eou__ Then when did you go to sleep ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . __eou__ When ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock . __eou__ Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? __eou__ You did , but I can ’ t help it . __eou__ This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? __eou__ Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . __eou__ So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . __eou__ Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . __eou__
I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . __eou__ Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? __eou__ I've tried it , but he would have none of it . __eou__
Are you cold ? __eou__ Yes , a little . __eou__ I wonder if we can change the temperature . __eou__ I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . __eou__ There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? __eou__ I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . __eou__ Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . __eou__ I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . __eou__ What did they say about the air conditioning ? __eou__ They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . __eou__ That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? __eou__ You can wear more clothes . __eou__
Are you there , Mary ? __eou__ I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! __eou__ How much is my stamp ? __eou__ Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? __eou__ Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . __eou__ His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . __eou__
I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . __eou__ I will try my best . __eou__
I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . __eou__ Never mind about that . __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? __eou__ No , I won ’ t hear of it . __eou__
How do you like the pizza here ? __eou__ Perfect . It really hits the spot . __eou__
Yes , sir ? __eou__ I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . __eou__ I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . __eou__
How do you do , Prof.Smith . __eou__ How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . __eou__ Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . __eou__ It's amazing . __eou__
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Where is she going to college ? __eou__ She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . __eou__ Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . __eou__ These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . __eou__ Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? __eou__ We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . __eou__ You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . __eou__
I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful ! __eou__ You are pretending ! __eou__ No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ? __eou__ It's wrong because---it isn't true . __eou__ You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ? __eou__ Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again . __eou__ Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long . __eou__
Adam . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Well . You ’ re here . __eou__
What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . __eou__ You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . __eou__ Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . __eou__ It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . __eou__ Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? __eou__ Yes , they say I would get a big sum . __eou__ Have you discussed it with your wife ? __eou__ Yes , she leaves it to me . __eou__ As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . __eou__ I have to think about it . __eou__
Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? __eou__ I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . __eou__ You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? __eou__ That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . __eou__ Did you tell your parents yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . __eou__ They're probably going to be so happy . __eou__ I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . __eou__
Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . __eou__ How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . __eou__ But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . __eou__
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
I must apologize for having delayed the work . __eou__ No , that ’ s not all your fault . __eou__ But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry __eou__ There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it . __eou__
It ’ s really terrible ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? __eou__ Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . __eou__ You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children . __eou__
He has come to life in the end . __eou__ Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . __eou__ Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . __eou__ Right . Unless , who know what will happen . __eou__ Wish him to be healthy soon . __eou__
Peter is a bag lady now . __eou__ That black sheep . It serves him right . __eou__ He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . __eou__ It ’ s too late . __eou__
What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! __eou__ Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . __eou__ It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . __eou__ Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . __eou__ That's quite a compliment coming from you . __eou__
You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? __eou__ No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . __eou__ Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? __eou__ No , thanks . I am okay . __eou__ You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... __eou__ Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? __eou__ I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . __eou__ You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . __eou__ I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . __eou__ I hope you will have second thoughts . __eou__
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . __eou__ But they ’ re very nice , you know . __eou__ Really . __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . __eou__
You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . __eou__
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , can I return this article , please ? __eou__ May I know the reason , madam ? __eou__ You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . __eou__ When did you buy it ? __eou__ Last Saturday . __eou__ Can I see the receipt ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . __eou__
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . __eou__ Just because he gets on well with everybody ? __eou__ Partly , and he's also a hardworking man . __eou__
I was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ Do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . __eou__ What are your main concerns ? __eou__ Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . __eou__ I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . __eou__ I am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . __eou__ I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . __eou__
The academy is an important part of the education system . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__
You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . __eou__
Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__ That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__ Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . __eou__
Do you think you could keep the noise down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? __eou__ Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . __eou__
Crazy ! He locked himself in the room . __eou__ I think he was locked in it . __eou__ But you can see the key in his hand through the window ! __eou__ What a strange guy ! __eou__
You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? __eou__ I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . __eou__ I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , too good to be true . __eou__
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . __eou__ What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . __eou__ I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . __eou__ Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . __eou__ You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? __eou__ But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . __eou__ Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . __eou__ Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . __eou__ I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . __eou__ Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . __eou__ That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . __eou__ How about a training course ? __eou__ A training course ? That must be costly . __eou__ But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . __eou__ You flatter me . __eou__
Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . __eou__ Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . __eou__ OK . I will talk to him direcly . __eou__
What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! __eou__ I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . __eou__ You have a real talent , Ellen ! __eou__ I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . __eou__
Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! __eou__ Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . __eou__ Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! __eou__ Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . __eou__ Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! __eou__ Um ... no . __eou__ Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! __eou__
Our major is from a bigger city . __eou__ He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . __eou__ He brings with him some talented people from his former city . __eou__ I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . __eou__ That's a wonderful choice . __eou__ I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . __eou__ January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . __eou__ Yes , maybe another choice might be better . __eou__ I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . __eou__ Thank you for thinking of that . __eou__ Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . __eou__ That is a good idea . __eou__ I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Why do you look so sad ? __eou__ I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . __eou__ Why not go and see a doctor ? __eou__ I never trust those stupid doctors . __eou__
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . __eou__ If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . __eou__ Yes , it is annoying . __eou__
You have your ducks in a row . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . __eou__
Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? __eou__ He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . __eou__ That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . __eou__ Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . __eou__
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . __eou__
Hey , Cindy , I'm so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__ I don't know what happened to me . I just lost it . __eou__ I think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . Good night . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . __eou__ Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__ Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . __eou__ Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing . __eou__ I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__ You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! __eou__
Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . __eou__ Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ How ’ s that going ? __eou__ It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . __eou__ Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . __eou__

I'm sorry I'm late . __eou__ Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . __eou__ The bus I took . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I took the wrong bus . __eou__ Oh , did you ? That's very easy to do . __eou__
You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . __eou__ And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves . __eou__ But you're not to blame for them keeping him there . __eou__ Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . __eou__ Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick . __eou__ I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . __eou__ I know only too well what that's like . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was very sad when I was laid off last year . __eou__
What happened to my cup ? __eou__ I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use . __eou__
Every teacher likes him . __eou__ They say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ Maybe he's gifted in that . __eou__
I love that vase . __eou__ Do you really like it ? __eou__ Yes , it looks perfect . __eou__ It wasn't very expensive either . __eou__ That's amazing ! __eou__
Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? __eou__ No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? __eou__ Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . __eou__ She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . __eou__ Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . __eou__
I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . __eou__ But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . __eou__ However , he disappointed us very much this time . __eou__ I can understand that . But ... __eou__
Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy . __eou__ Right . You're right . But she's just evil . Someone should drive a stake through her heart . __eou__ Elvin , please . Can I count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? __eou__ I'm OK . I'll be fine . I'v cool . I'm cold . I'm like ice . She won't know what hit her . __eou__ By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . __eou__
I've just been a little depressed lately . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ Nothing really . __eou__ Then just keep your chin up . __eou__
Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college . __eou__ Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . __eou__ But I always feel disappointed .

I feel so frustrated . __eou__ Be confident , and never give up . __eou__ I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . __eou__ Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . __eou__ Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . __eou__
Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . __eou__ I was playing a joke on you . __eou__ That ’ s too much . __eou__ Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__ Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__ They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work .

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You're all the same . __eou__

Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago .

They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
Are things still going badly with your house guest ? __eou__ It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . __eou__
What's wrong with him ? __eou__ His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . __eou__

She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__ They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . __eou__ That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? __eou__
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . __eou__ If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . __eou__ I did .

What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__ It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__ Sure . __eou__

How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__
Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . __eou__ It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . __eou__ All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . __eou__ It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__ Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . __eou__ That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . __eou__
Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! __eou__ Is everything OK ? __eou__ Just get over here ! __eou__ Come in ! Quickly ! __eou__ So , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . __eou__ Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__ Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__ OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__ You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! __eou__
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me .

Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! __eou__

I can't wait for the weekend ! __eou__ your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? __eou__ you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! __eou__ that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . __eou__ really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . __eou__ maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! __eou__ no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T . __eou__ try not to let it bother you too much . __eou__ thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! __eou__ ok , I'll see you in a bit . __eou__ alright . See you later ! __eou__

Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty . __eou__
I prefer potatoes to eggplants . __eou__ I feel eggplants are more nutritious . __eou__ But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . __eou__ Oh , that's how you see it . __eou__

Would you like a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes.That would be good . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ This machine is out of order . __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Many congratulations on your winning the game . __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . __eou__ You were doing great out there ! __eou__ Well , actually it ’ s just about luck . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . __eou__ Self-service ? __eou__ Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . Are you traveling here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . __eou__ In America , most gas stations are like this . __eou__ Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . __eou__ Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . __eou__ What sign ? __eou__ Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . __eou__ I see . __eou__
It's taking you forever to do my hair . __eou__ Give me a minute . __eou__ You should've been done already . __eou__ There you go . __eou__ I don't think that you're done . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ My hair looks hideous . __eou__ What's so bad about it ? __eou__ It doesn't look good at all . __eou__ Sorry about that . __eou__ I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . __eou__ Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__ How dreadful ! __eou__ Look at the view from the window . __eou__ Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__ It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__ Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__ Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__
Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? __eou__ A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hey Tina . What are you doing ? __eou__ I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ? __eou__ I just watched a movie and I'm scared . __eou__ What did you watch ? __eou__ I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary . __eou__ I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary . __eou__ If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone . __eou__ Sure . I can come over . What should we do ? __eou__ How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense . __eou__ Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes . __eou__ Hurry , ok . It's dark out . __eou__ Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon . __eou__ Ok . See you soon . __eou__
Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . __eou__ Let ’ s go for a joy ride . __eou__
Are you almost finished with my hair ? __eou__ I'm almost finished . __eou__ How much longer is it going to be ? __eou__ I'm done now . Do you like it ? __eou__ I absolutely love it . __eou__ You really like it ? __eou__ Yes , I truly do . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ How much do I owe you ? __eou__ It's going to be $ 55 . __eou__ Here you go , thanks for everything . __eou__ Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks . __eou__
Let's do something different today . __eou__ Like how ? __eou__ I would like you to give me a different hair style . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ Give me a short haircut . __eou__ Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? __eou__ I want you to cut it to a few inches long . __eou__ That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? __eou__ I've had this idea for some time now . __eou__ I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . __eou__ This is what I want . __eou__ Fine then . Let's get started . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! __eou__ Thank you.You ' re partial . __eou__ I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . __eou__ It's nice to hear that anyway . __eou__
are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__ that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way . __eou__
Are you listening to me , Dan ? __eou__ I'm with you , Jane . __eou__ What did I just say ? __eou__ Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part . __eou__ Just what I thought ! __eou__
Look at that pretty girl . __eou__ Wow ! She's gorgeous . __eou__
Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . __eou__ Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . __eou__ Why are we watching it anyway ? __eou__ Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . __eou__ True . True . __eou__ Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? __eou__ Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ You want something to drink ? __eou__ Yeah , Got a Coke ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Hurry , the movie is coming back on . __eou__
Do you have to leave soon ? __eou__ No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . __eou__ Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . __eou__ He knows you very well . __eou__ He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . __eou__ I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . __eou__ No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . __eou__
Oh , no ! Now I'll be late . __eou__ Can I give you a hand ? __eou__ Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . __eou__ Sure thing . I've got time . __eou__
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? __eou__ Sorry . You know the rules . __eou__ But I want to watch TV now . __eou__ That ’ s out of the question . __eou__ Please . __eou__ Not a chance . __eou__ Not even for an hour ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s impossible . __eou__
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . __eou__ Oh , How annoying ! __eou__ The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__ It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? __eou__ Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . __eou__ So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__ You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . __eou__ But you know if he brought it or not , right ? __eou__ Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . __eou__
Mike ! Look at the floor ! __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! __eou__ Oh ... __eou__ It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . __eou__ Sorry , love . __eou__ What are you looking for now ? __eou__ My cigarettes . __eou__ Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . __eou__ In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? __eou__
So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . __eou__ You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__ I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance . __eou__ I'm glad I could help . __eou__ Here's the check . I included a little extra for you . __eou__ You didn't have to do that ! __eou__ I know , but you deserve it . __eou__
He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
I hear little Bob has recovered . __eou__ That's a great relief . I was worried about him . __eou__ The operation was very successful . __eou__ His parents must feel very happy . __eou__
This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . __eou__ En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . __eou__
Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? __eou__ The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . __eou__ But this chance is really precious . __eou__ Well , I know . So I am thinking now . __eou__ I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . __eou__
How are you , Sue ? __eou__ Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s your brother ? __eou__ He is fine . __eou__ He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . __eou__ Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . __eou__
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__ Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . __eou__
Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers __eou__ Until when ? __eou__ Until Monday or Tuesday next week . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . __eou__
Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . __eou__ You do ? OK , fine with me . __eou__ Thank you SO much . __eou__ But I also want ya to do me a favor . __eou__ What ? __eou__ You gotta have some better deodorant . __eou__ I ’ m sorry ? ! __eou__
Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . __eou__ Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__ Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__
