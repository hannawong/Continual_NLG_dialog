That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University . __eou__ Yes , we are very proud of her . __eou__ Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? __eou__ Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? __eou__ No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . __eou__ I'd like to see that myself . __eou__ Have a wallet size print made for me , too . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it . __eou__ I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . __eou__ I think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__ Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . __eou__
Do you like playing tennis ? __eou__ I don't find it very exciting . __eou__ Maybe you haven't found the magic . __eou__ I can't wait ! __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
Eric , how long will you be in China ? __eou__ I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? __eou__ How about this sunday ? __eou__ Ok , cool . __eou__ Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Wow ! It ’ s packed . __eou__ The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! __eou__ There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? __eou__ Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . __eou__ Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? __eou__ No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? __eou__ I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . __eou__ I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . __eou__ I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . __eou__ I think that would be horrible ! __eou__ I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! __eou__
You look like being on cloud nine . __eou__ I am . __eou__ What has made you so happy ? __eou__ I think I'm in love . __eou__ Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? __eou__ Her name is Jenny . __eou__ How did you meet her ? __eou__ We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . __eou__ What do you like best about her ? __eou__ She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . __eou__ I guess it was fate working to bring you together . __eou__ Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . __eou__
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . __eou__ Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__
I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done . __eou__ You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat . __eou__
Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! __eou__

I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . __eou__ Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . __eou__
I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! __eou__ That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__
I ran into a glass door yesterday . __eou__ What a bone head ! Be careful next time . __eou__
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__ That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! __eou__
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! __eou__ No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__ Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! __eou__ Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? __eou__ Well . How do you know ? __eou__
That's a very nice pair of glasses . __eou__ Does it really look OK ? __eou__ Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . __eou__ And I got it on sale . __eou__ That's incredible ! __eou__
My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! __eou__ So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? __eou__
Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? __eou__ I can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__
Here's your drink , sir . __eou__ No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . __eou__ Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . __eou__ Waiter ! __eou__ Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . __eou__ It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . __eou__ Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . __eou__ I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . __eou__ I'm really sorry . __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
How would you like your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it short . __eou__ Then , I'll just trim it . __eou__ It will do . __eou__
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . __eou__ Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? __eou__ What's your method of learning ? __eou__ Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other . __eou__ That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__ Turn on the TV for what ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . __eou__
David , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ I am not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh , I just can't forget it . __eou__
Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? __eou__ Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . __eou__ Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . __eou__
I got the job you recommended me for last week . __eou__ That's great ! Congratulations . __eou__ I really don't know how I can thank you enough . __eou__ Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position . __eou__ Thank you very much indeed.You helped me rebuild my self-confidence . __eou__ Don't mention it.You ' re always been good.What do you say we go out to celebrate ? __eou__ That would be great . __eou__
Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? __eou__ Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I can tell you worked hard on it . __eou__ I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . __eou__ Well , it was definitely worth all the time . __eou__ Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . __eou__
You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . __eou__ Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon . __eou__ I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her . __eou__
Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ? __eou__ Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . __eou__ Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? __eou__ No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it . __eou__ I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . __eou__ Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you . __eou__ Ok , Miss . I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner . __eou__
I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days . __eou__ It really depends on when and how long __eou__ Until next weekend . that ’ s ok . __eou__
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I am impressed . __eou__ Thank you .

But I'm always caught short . __eou__ But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . __eou__
I have a problem . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ The delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ I was late for work because of them . __eou__ Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ It shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ I'm going to refund your money right now . __eou__
You're going to abandon me , just like that ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . __eou__
Are you an American ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you speak English ? __eou__ Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . __eou__ Oh , do you like Chinese ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ Very Good . I'd like to do that . __eou__ When will we begin ? __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , come and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the radio then ? __eou__ Turn on the radio ?

But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . __eou__
I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . __eou__ You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__ You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . __eou__
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . __eou__ Young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__ It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__ But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . __eou__
so , how should we go to the theatre ? __eou__ let's take the bus . __eou__ I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? __eou__ we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . __eou__ fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . __eou__ don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It's a boy . __eou__
I really dislike reading academic books . __eou__ That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . __eou__
