Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . __eou__ You might want to try the mangoes . __eou__ Can you describe a mango to me ? __eou__ It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit .

Sixty-four ? __eou__ Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? __eou__ History . __eou__ Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers .

I want PC . __eou__ I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__ What ? Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__ That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . __eou__ Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . __eou__ But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . __eou__ There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . __eou__ Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__ No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__ You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__

Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? __eou__ Yes , but it's quite a ways . __eou__ Do I need to take a bus ? __eou__ This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk .

I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! __eou__ Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? __eou__ Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . __eou__ Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! __eou__

I will look into the matter . __eou__ This is very annoying . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . __eou__ No , I don't risk it . __eou__ How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ? __eou__ I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening . __eou__ I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come . __eou__
Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? __eou__ Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . __eou__ So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? __eou__ I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . __eou__ And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ They're much better __eou__ But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ I suppose so . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? __eou__ Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ? __eou__ Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ? __eou__ Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens . __eou__ How much more do I have to pay ? __eou__ Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more . __eou__ That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train . __eou__ OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool . __eou__ I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . __eou__ Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . __eou__ Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . __eou__ See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . __eou__ Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . __eou__ You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? __eou__ They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . __eou__ Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? __eou__ Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? __eou__ Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . __eou__ Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . __eou__ Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? __eou__ It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can . __eou__ It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing . __eou__ Here we go . __eou__
Are you going to come home late tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I've got to work overtime . __eou__
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? __eou__ We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . __eou__ I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . __eou__ You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? __eou__ Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . __eou__ While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . __eou__ We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . __eou__ I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . __eou__ Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . __eou__ No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__ Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . __eou__ And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? __eou__ Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? __eou__ Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . __eou__
Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now . __eou__ Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it __eou__ Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . __eou__ Sure thing . __eou__ I do wish your christmas and happy new year . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I'd like to buy a watch . __eou__ Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? __eou__ Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... __eou__ How about this one ? It's graceful in style . __eou__ Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ 500 dollars , Madam . __eou__ I wonder if it keeps good time . __eou__ Surely . As this is the latest model , and you can also set the alarm . __eou__ How do I set it ? __eou__ Just do like this.Very simple . __eou__ All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It . __eou__
Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . __eou__ You do ? OK , fine with me . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ But I also want ya to do me a favor . __eou__ What ? __eou__ You gotta have some better deodorant . __eou__ I ’ m sorry ? ! __eou__
the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__ I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys __eou__ so , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam __eou__ yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . __eou__ how long did it take you to do the tiling . __eou__ as I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to information I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . The __eou__ I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__ you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . __eou__
It's been a long time , Mrs , Lee . __eou__ Yes . I went to Hawaii on a vacation with my husband . __eou__ When did you come back ? Did you have a good time ? __eou__ We came back the day before yesterday . I enjoyed myself there very much . The beach is beautiful . You should go there some day . The sun was lovely , too . __eou__ I will . How would you like your hair today ? The same style as usual ? __eou__ I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ’ m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ? __eou__ That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ? __eou__ No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too . __eou__ Very well . You aren't in a hurry , are you ? __eou__ No , you can take your time . Oh , I also want a manicure while I am having the perm . __eou__ Ok . The manicurist will be right here . __eou__ Thank you . How much will this cost ? __eou__ It's 90 dollars in all . __eou__
Excuse me , please show me that business suit , the dark one . __eou__ OK . __eou__ May I try it on ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__
Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? __eou__ Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . __eou__ Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . __eou__ I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . __eou__ Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . __eou__ Promise that you won't get angry . __eou__ OK , I promise . What is it ? __eou__ It's a kitty . __eou__ Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . __eou__ Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . __eou__ No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . __eou__ Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . __eou__ All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . __eou__ I will . Thank you , Mummy . __eou__
Excuse me . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Could you tell me where the copy room is ? __eou__ Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . __eou__
Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ It ’ s the one you like . __eou__ Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one . __eou__ Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ’ rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ’ s nothing damaged , we ’ ll give you back one month ’ s rent when you move out . You ’ ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? __eou__ Sure ! __eou__ Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back . __eou__ Okay . Thank you for your reminder . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . __eou__ Thank you again . __eou__
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . __eou__ What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . __eou__ But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . __eou__ Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . __eou__
Would you like some drinks ? __eou__ Yes , what kinds of wine do you have ? __eou__ We have various kinds of wine . As for an appetizer , I advise you to order white wine or dry white wine . __eou__ Thank you . Please bring us a bottle of dry white wine . __eou__

Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? __eou__ Pretty well . What about you ? __eou__ Fine . Where are the other guys ? __eou__ It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . __eou__ Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? __eou__ Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . __eou__ Did you go to a real estate agent ? __eou__ No , that will be too expensive . __eou__ That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? __eou__ My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . __eou__ Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it so much . __eou__
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__ You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ I drink a lot of wine . __eou__ If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ I often feel so tired . __eou__ You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__
I've typed the report . __eou__ Well done . __eou__ And I've filed the letters . __eou__ Excellent job . __eou__ And I've checked the orders . __eou__ I'm very impressed . __eou__ And I've ordered the supplies . __eou__ Congratulations . You should be very proud of yourself . __eou__

I can take care of it here when you are already . __eou__ Do you accept checks ? __eou__ No , I'm sorry we don't .

I'd be glad to bring you some when I come back . __eou__ Yes , we do , thank you . __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__
Mom , can I have more allowance ? __eou__ What for ? __eou__ I want to buy more books . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? __eou__ Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . __eou__ Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . __eou__
Hi , Bob , everything okay ? __eou__ More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ Oh ? What's that ? __eou__ Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . __eou__ What gift ? __eou__ It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . __eou__ You refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__ I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . __eou__

Look in the want ads , but I don ’ t know what you ’ re going to find without a college degree . __eou__

I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? __eou__ That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . __eou__ I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe . __eou__ You would fit both of them in your bedroom .

I ’ m a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon . __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , I ’ ll be fine . __eou__ But what will you do if you need to know the price of something ? __eou__ If I need to know the price , I ’ ll just look at the label . __eou__ Ok , but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes ? __eou__ I'll try them on . __eou__ And what will you do if you don ’ t have enough cash ? __eou__ Then I ’ ll just use my credit card . __eou__
I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ? __eou__ Yeah , of course .

But , you shouldn't have a problem . __eou__ Are they safe ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . __eou__

It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ What kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ Sounds good .

Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ Of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ Has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__

I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? __eou__ For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__ Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece .

On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__

Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . __eou__ You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . __eou__ I ’ d better go tomorrow . __eou__ No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? __eou__
pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ sure , here you are . __eou__ thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__ yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u __eou__ yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . __eou__ yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__ exactly . __eou__
Take me to this address , please . __eou__ Yes , Ma'am . Here we are . __eou__ How much do I owe you , sir ? __eou__ 30 dollars , Ma'am . __eou__ Are you kidding ?

Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ There ’ s so much I want to do .

There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ That ’ s right .

Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time __eou__ How do I do that ? __eou__ Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will __eou__ That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . __eou__

Annie , do you like shopping online ? __eou__ Yes , I like it , because it's convenient . __eou__ Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it . __eou__ First , you should open an account at the online bank .

What do you think this flat ? __eou__ It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . __eou__ Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . __eou__ But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . __eou__ That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . __eou__ True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped . __eou__ It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__ You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__ May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . __eou__ I haven't thought of that . __eou__

Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . __eou__ I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__ Never mind .

So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? __eou__ Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? __eou__ I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that . __eou__ No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I could never do that . __eou__
You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? __eou__ Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . __eou__ Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . __eou__

The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . __eou__ You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! __eou__ Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? __eou__ I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? __eou__ How ’ s that ? __eou__ That ’ s better . Now what ? __eou__ Check your petrol situation . __eou__ The tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . __eou__ I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . __eou__ Remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! __eou__ Why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? __eou__
Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? __eou__ A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . __eou__ Oh , what a terrible situation !

I think that I would enjoy living here , but I would like to make improvements . __eou__ What would make this apartment better for you ? __eou__ I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet . __eou__ You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more . __eou__ How much more would it cost to upgrade ? __eou__ It could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard . __eou__ Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ? __eou__ I have to see a sample . Bring me one this week , please . __eou__ How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ? __eou__ Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week . __eou__
We have a holiday next week , don't we ? __eou__ Yes , on Monday . __eou__ What're you going to do ? __eou__ I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . __eou__ At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . __eou__ But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know.Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . __eou__ But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? __eou__ A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . __eou__
What do we need for the barbecue ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! __eou__ And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . __eou__ How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? __eou__ It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it . __eou__ I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! __eou__
So how's everything going for Christmas ? __eou__ I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with . __eou__ What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . __eou__ No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . __eou__ He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ? __eou__ Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ... __eou__ You think it's better that he should be told ? __eou__ Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do . __eou__ That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real . __eou__ I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son . __eou__ Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that . __eou__

I hate sending SMS messages . __eou__ Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . __eou__ I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? __eou__ I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . __eou__ No wonder you didn't get my texts ! __eou__

Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? __eou__ I think it is . __eou__ Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ? __eou__ I prefer the linen one . __eou__
Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . __eou__ But yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__ I ’ Ve changed my mind . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . __eou__

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__

Shouting won ’ t help ? __eou__ He is really outrageous . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed .

He can't do this to you . __eou__ Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I shouted it back of course . __eou__ Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? __eou__ What would you do if you were in my shoes ? __eou__ Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . __eou__ No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . __eou__ I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . __eou__ I am too angry to do that . __eou__

Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more ! __eou__

You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . __eou__ What about a two-bedroom house ? __eou__ A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . __eou__ I see . __eou__ I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . __eou__ Okay , I will take it into consideration . __eou__

I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? __eou__ I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . __eou__ Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ? __eou__ I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . __eou__

Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! __eou__ I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? __eou__ Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . __eou__
I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . __eou__
What is this eviction notice for ? __eou__ The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? __eou__ I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . __eou__ You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! __eou__ You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . __eou__ Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? __eou__ You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . __eou__ I am going to take care of the rent payment right now . __eou__ Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check . __eou__
Would you like to order now , madam ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms . __eou__ How would you like your steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? __eou__ I'd like it well done , please . __eou__ What kind of potatoes would like to go with that , mushed , boiled , or baked ? __eou__ I think i have bake potatoes.And i now have a ice tea with lemon on the side , please . __eou__ Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ? __eou__ I'd like cream onion soup please . __eou__ Will you have desert to be , madam ? __eou__ I want to skip desert.That all , thank you . __eou__ OK , I'll be with you in a moment . __eou__

What are you going to have to drink ? __eou__ I'm going to have a glass of beer . How about you ? __eou__ I think I'll have a glass of wine . __eou__ Do you want to order an appetizer first ? __eou__ Not really , maybe we can just order some bread . __eou__ OK . What are you going to have to eat ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I haven't decided yet . Can you recommend something ? __eou__ Sure , I've had the steak and the lobster before . They're both very good . __eou__ I think I'll have the lobster . What are you going to have ? __eou__ I'm not that hungry . I think I'm just going to have a salad . __eou__ I'm gonna go to the bathroom . When the waitress comes back , will you order for me ? __eou__ Sure . No problem . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please . __eou__ Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ? __eou__ Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . __eou__

Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__ You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__ Are you serious ? How can that be ? __eou__ Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . __eou__ Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . __eou__ That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! __eou__ Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__ You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__ Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__ Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__ What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . __eou__ Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . __eou__ Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . __eou__ Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . __eou__ Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . __eou__

I hope I haven ’ t lost it . __eou__ Perhaps you left that at school . __eou__ No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . __eou__ Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . __eou__ But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . __eou__ Perhaps I should call her later . __eou__
I need to get my high speed internet installed . __eou__ You'll need to make an appointment . __eou__ Could I do that right now , please ? __eou__ What day would you like us to do the installation ? __eou__ Is Friday good ? __eou__ We're only available at 3 __eou__ You can't come any earlier than that ? __eou__ I'm sorry .

I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . __eou__
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . __eou__ Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? __eou__ yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? __eou__ come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! __eou__ when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . __eou__ maybe you have a point . __eou__ make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . __eou__ all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! __eou__ that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . __eou__ oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . __eou__ exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney !

Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? __eou__ No . I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed . __eou__ Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ Because it helps you speed up your circulation . __eou__ Then I won't say no to that . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I feel totally refreshed . __eou__ We have discount coupons . 100 Yuan for ten times .

Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house . __eou__ To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ I think that maybe I should accept their offer . __eou__ You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer . __eou__ I want to make another offer , but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house . __eou__ There is always a chance that someone could outbid you , but you could try one more offer if you like . __eou__ I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer . __eou__ Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer . __eou__

Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . __eou__ Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect ! I'll take it ! __eou__
Pete's Pizza , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I have one of your buy one , get one free coupons , and I'd like to order two large pizzas . __eou__ Will that be for pick-up or delivery ? __eou__ Delivery , please . __eou__ Can I get your phone number ? __eou__ Sure .

I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . __eou__ Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__ Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . __eou__ Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? __eou__ Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . __eou__ Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? __eou__ Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . __eou__ And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . __eou__ Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . __eou__

The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? __eou__ No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . __eou__ So what do you think it is ? __eou__ I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? __eou__ Umm . yeah !

I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . __eou__ Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . __eou__ The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . __eou__

It must be one of the famous local dishes . __eou__ Yes . It's a traditional dish . __eou__ And it must be very particular in cooking . __eou__ You are right , sir .

It's on our back lot . __eou__ This is a Porsche ! __eou__ Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . __eou__ Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__ But how can you do that ? __eou__ It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it almost looks new . __eou__
Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? __eou__ I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . __eou__ Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . __eou__ Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__ I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__ Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . __eou__ It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . __eou__ Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? __eou__ Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__ Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__ Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__ It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . __eou__ How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . __eou__ I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . __eou__
The dinner is really rich . __eou__ Which dish do you like most ? __eou__ I like the soy sauce chicken . __eou__ Actually , it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially . __eou__

Where are your digital watches ? __eou__ Right here . __eou__ I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? __eou__ Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__ He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out .

But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them .

That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . __eou__

Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . __eou__ It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! __eou__
It looks delicious . I will order it . __eou__ I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . __eou__ Would you please make it for a single person ? __eou__ Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . __eou__
Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested . Tell me about them . __eou__ Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . __eou__ That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . __eou__
Here we are on the train . __eou__ Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__ I hear many people have cars . __eou__ Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . __eou__ Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? __eou__ Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ? __eou__ Yes , and I think I have good news for you . __eou__ Did they accept the counter-offer ? __eou__ Yes , they accepted your counter-offer , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . __eou__ How much will that cost ? __eou__ It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection . __eou__ Can I choose the home inspector ? __eou__ Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one . __eou__ So , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ? __eou__ I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news . __eou__
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . __eou__ What part hurts ? __eou__ The shoulder . __eou__ Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . __eou__ It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__ C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__ I'm bleeding too much . __eou__ We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? __eou__ Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__ There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__ Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__ I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! __eou__ We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__ I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . __eou__ Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? __eou__ Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . __eou__ Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . __eou__ There . Stop ! __eou__
Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory . __eou__ I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash . __eou__ Don't worry about it.It ' s on me . __eou__ In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . __eou__ I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . __eou__ Are you on the up and up ? __eou__ Definitely . you know , I'm into serious sport in a big way . __eou__ If you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . __eou__ come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . __eou__ Fat chance , I'm too scared of bungee jumping . __eou__ No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . __eou__ What did that have to do with me ? I'm not the self-seeker like you . __eou__ I can teach you how . __eou__ I had a sneaking suspicion about you , Eric , I think you've lost it . __eou__ No , not really , but I think I have lost my wallet . Where can it be ? __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ My daughter . She is missing .

Should I go now ? __eou__ Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . __eou__ Nothing is happening ! __eou__ First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive . __eou__ What do these other letters mean ? __eou__ R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'm looking for a house . __eou__ To buy or to rent ? __eou__ Oh , to rent . __eou__ How much do you want to pay ? __eou__ About 300 a month . __eou__ Well , I've got one here .

See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! __eou__ I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage .

You know how kids are . __eou__ Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed .

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__

Come with me , please . __eou__
Excuse me , I'm looking for your English textbooks . __eou__ They're right over there , next to the dictionaries . __eou__ Do you have any textbooks to help improve students ' reading skills ? __eou__ Let ' s see .

I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . __eou__ What words ?

If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . __eou__ It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . __eou__ Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . __eou__ I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . __eou__
You like this china tea set , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ? __eou__ Sure.How about the brown one ? __eou__ No , I don't like the brown one . __eou__ The blue one ? __eou__ Good , I like it . __eou__ You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen . __eou__ It is extremely beautiful.This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.Please put in a gift box for me . __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__

Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' .

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . __eou__

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart !

I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ? __eou__ That's not a bad idea .

Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . __eou__ Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . __eou__ I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . __eou__ Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . __eou__ Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? __eou__ Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? __eou__ History . __eou__ Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . __eou__ Thirty percent ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? __eou__ Yes . It's an excellent system . __eou__ Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? __eou__ Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . __eou__ I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . __eou__ I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__ What ? Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__ That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . __eou__ Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . __eou__ But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . __eou__ There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . __eou__ Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__ No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__ You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__
Hey , Mom , look what I found ! __eou__ Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I would like to return an item . __eou__ What are you returning ? __eou__ I want to return this cellphone . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ It's broken . __eou__ What exactly is wrong with it ? __eou__ The phone turns off by itself . __eou__ That's fine , but do you have your receipt with you ? __eou__ Yes , here it is . __eou__ I'll refund your money right now . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
I lost my wallet . __eou__ I'm sorry , that's bad luck . __eou__

Mum , pass me some more please ! __eou__ Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don't eat these crisps any more . __eou__ But the ads say they're most nutritious . __eou__ Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? __eou__
Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . __eou__ Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . __eou__ I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . __eou__ Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . __eou__ And we ’ ll all help you . __eou__

What's this , honey ? __eou__ Er , is it cabbage ? __eou__ Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage . __eou__ Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food . __eou__ There we go . __eou__ Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ? __eou__ Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . __eou__
This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! __eou__ Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby .

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__

What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__
Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . __eou__ Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . __eou__ Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . __eou__ That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . __eou__ My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? __eou__ Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . __eou__ What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . __eou__ That was last time . This time it's worse . __eou__ Ok , tell me . __eou__ Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... __eou__ And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . __eou__ True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... __eou__ Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . __eou__ And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . __eou__ At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . __eou__ Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . __eou__ Hmm , that is bad . __eou__
Ouch ! The water's too hot ! __eou__ Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it .

You'll get too weak if you don't eat . __eou__ Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? __eou__ That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? __eou__
what do we need to get from the supermarket ? __eou__ we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . __eou__ a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? __eou__ just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . __eou__ we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . __eou__ I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? __eou__ I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . __eou__ ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . __eou__ we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . __eou__ ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? __eou__ I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . __eou__ let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . __eou__ I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go . __eou__

Thank you . __eou__

And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . __eou__ That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner __eou__ And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? __eou__ They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce __eou__ But they aren't as light , right ? __eou__ That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . __eou__ That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . __eou__ But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . __eou__ My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive .

You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to see one of those ties . __eou__ You mean this one ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ It's pretty , isn't it ? It's made of pure silk and it's on sale . __eou__ OK .

How much is the rent ? __eou__ It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . __eou__ That definitely sounds like a steal .

Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__
May I take your order now ? __eou__ Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . __eou__ Do you want some salad dressing ? __eou__ Yes , what kind do you have ? __eou__ We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese . __eou__ I think French will be fine . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . __eou__ They are very nice , you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh . I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody's buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion . There are so many other really important things in the world . __eou__
May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ? __eou__ I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is . __eou__ You are such a good father . It's next Sunday . __eou__ Sorry . What shall we get for her ? __eou__ What about a cell phone ? She is old enough to have one . __eou__ Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? __eou__ Maybe we can try shopping on line . __eou__ Sure . Okay , here is the website . __eou__ I'm sure that May would love the pink one . __eou__ Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . __eou__ Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ? __eou__ The computer went frozen . __eou__ Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later . __eou__
Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! __eou__ Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold . __eou__ Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ? __eou__ No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something . __eou__ Whatever . Have a drink of water . __eou__ Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already . __eou__ Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit . __eou__ Do we ? Where is it ? __eou__ Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it . __eou__ Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on . __eou__ Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no ! __eou__ What's the new strike ? __eou__ Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration . __eou__ Poor me ! __eou__
Good afternoon , how may I help you ? __eou__ Hi , I'd like to order some flowers . __eou__ Who are they for ? __eou__ They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha . __eou__ What kind of flowers would you like ? __eou__ I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ? __eou__ OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ? __eou__ Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers . __eou__ Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . __eou__ Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses . __eou__ Roses will be fine . __eou__ What color ? __eou__ I think red would be nice . __eou__ Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ? __eou__ Can you deliver them , please ? __eou__ What's the address ? __eou__ 241 Main street . __eou__
Have you been coming to this Laundromat long ? __eou__ I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ It doesn't cost me as much to wash here . __eou__ I've just started doing my clothes here . __eou__ Why are you washing your clothes here now ? __eou__ My washing machine broke down . __eou__ You should just pay someone to fix it . __eou__ It's too expensive to get it fixed . __eou__ So you're just going to wash here ? __eou__ Yeah , I think that's what I'm going to have to do . __eou__ It costs less to wash here . __eou__
I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . __eou__ What size do you want ? __eou__ I wear size 40 . __eou__ How about this one ? It's the latest design . __eou__ Oh , I like the color . __eou__
Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . __eou__ Great . Where is it ? __eou__ A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . __eou__ What about the surrounding area ? __eou__ Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . __eou__ That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__ Yeah , it's near a bus stop . __eou__ Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . __eou__
May I please speak to Robert ? __eou__ There is no one here by that name . __eou__ Is this 2517758 ? __eou__ No , this is 2517759 . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__

Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__ I guess you are right . __eou__ Believe me . Everything will be ok . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__

Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number . __eou__ That's it ? __eou__ Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident . __eou__
I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . __eou__ It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . __eou__ What instructions ? __eou__ We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . __eou__ I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . __eou__ Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! __eou__ Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? __eou__ Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . __eou__ Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? __eou__ The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . __eou__ Sawdust ? __eou__ Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . __eou__ That makes sense . __eou__ Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . __eou__ And I can choose any color ? __eou__ Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . __eou__ And after the varnish ? __eou__ After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . __eou__ It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . __eou__ Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . __eou__ Alright , sir . __eou__
I ’ m moving out . __eou__ Your lease isn ’ t up yet . __eou__ I won ’ t be able to stay here anymore . __eou__ That ’ s going to be a problem . __eou__ I don ’ t know why there ’ s a problem . __eou__ It ’ s a problem because I can ’ t give you your deposit back . __eou__ Why can ’ t you give it back to me ? __eou__ You ’ re breaking our contract . __eou__ I ’ m going to need my deposit back . __eou__ That ’ s not going to happen . __eou__ I can ’ t stay here , though . __eou__ That ’ s really not my problem . __eou__
The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? __eou__ By credit card . __eou__ We take Visa and Master Card . __eou__ Do you take American Express ? __eou__ No , we don't . __eou__ Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are . __eou__ Thank you ... please sign on the line . __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__
Hi , how are you ? __eou__ It's nice to meet you .

I'll take the escalator . __eou__ Good luck . I hope someone can help you . __eou__
What are you having for lunch ? __eou__ I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda . __eou__ Did you bring that from home ? __eou__ I got it from the cafeteria . __eou__ What kind of sandwich did you get ? __eou__ They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good . __eou__ I think I got a sandwich there once before . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , and they didn't get my order right either . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , what sort of warranty comes with this stereo ? __eou__ Well , our store offers a 90 - Day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on any factory defects . __eou__ What conditions are there on the store policy ? __eou__ We ’ ll give you your money back as long as the stereo is returned in the original packaging and with a receipt . __eou__ O . K . How do I get the manufacturer ’ s warranty ? __eou__ Just send in the warranty card with a copy of your receipt . __eou__ All right , those sound good . I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Very well , I can ring you up over here , sir . __eou__

And for a hard one , only $ 6 . __eou__ Then one hard seat , please . __eou__ OK . Here is your change . The train leaves on platform 8 . __eou__
My child is often absent-minded in class . __eou__ It's all right . Kids are like that . __eou__ But if he doesn't listen to the teacher carefully , he won't learn anything . __eou__ Don't worry . His teacher will tell him to be good . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__

Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . __eou__ Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? __eou__ I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . __eou__ Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? __eou__ No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . __eou__ You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . __eou__ I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . __eou__ Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there . __eou__
How long do you plan on staying ? __eou__ I don't know ! Can I park my car now ? __eou__ We are open from nine to nine . So be sure to be back by then . __eou__ Fine ! I'll be back by nine then .

Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ? __eou__ OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite . __eou__ Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you . __eou__

This is our sale period . __eou__ It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ? __eou__ Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here . __eou__ I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ? __eou__ I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash . __eou__
Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? __eou__ We can take a bus there . __eou__ Does this bus go there ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Let's step in , Dad . __eou__ No , it's too crowded . __eou__ Dad . Here comes another bus . __eou__ Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! __eou__ Why ? Dad ? __eou__ We got on the wrong bus . __eou__
Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . __eou__ Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . __eou__ Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? __eou__ But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . __eou__ How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? __eou__ There are four more stops . __eou__ Oh , my God ! __eou__ What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! __eou__ Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? __eou__ No , not on the train , but in the station . __eou__ Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? __eou__ Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . __eou__ I guess you'll never forget today . __eou__
Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . __eou__ Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . __eou__ And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . __eou__ Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! __eou__ Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__
What do we need to get from the supermarket ? __eou__ We need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . __eou__ A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? __eou__ Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . __eou__ we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . __eou__ I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? __eou__ I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . __eou__ Ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . __eou__ We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . __eou__ Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? __eou__ I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . __eou__ let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . __eou__ I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ? __eou__ Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks . __eou__ Is it far from here ? __eou__ No , it ’ s only ten-minute's walk . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__

Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . __eou__
I'm looking for some lipsticks . Do you still have some in peach rose ? __eou__ Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left . __eou__ Great . I'll take one . __eou__ Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow . __eou__ Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? __eou__ I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? __eou__ That ’ s all . __eou__
Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? __eou__ Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . __eou__ Do I have to turn on the computer ? __eou__ yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time .

What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? __eou__ I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__ Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? __eou__ I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__ Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__ Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . __eou__
Can I help you , Madam ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband . Which style is the latest ? __eou__ These are all the latest fashion . How do you like this white turtleneck one ? __eou__ I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion . __eou__ We also have it in grey . __eou__ Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ? __eou__ It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well . __eou__ Let me see . Yes , they are perfectly matched ! __eou__
We have a holiday next week , don't we ? __eou__ Yes , on Monday . __eou__ What're you going to do ? __eou__ I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . __eou__ At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . __eou__ But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . __eou__ But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? __eou__ A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . __eou__

Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . __eou__ I feel kind of stupid . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . __eou__ You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__ No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__ You could have called . __eou__ I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ Guess where we ended up . __eou__ I don't know . Where ? __eou__ When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__ Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ I know it is . I don't know how it happened . __eou__ Hmm , maybe I do . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Maybe I have an idea how it happened . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ Oh , that's what you think , huh ? __eou__
Do you have any tables ? __eou__ Yes . We've got plenty of tables in stock . Will you have a look at this one ? __eou__ It's a nice color , and the style is not bad , but a bit too small . I'd like to get a slightly larger one . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ Mmm , I like it . How much is it ? __eou__ Seventy US dollars . __eou__ Here is the money . Could you deliver this to my house ? __eou__ Of course . We are always at your service . __eou__ Here is my name card . Thanks . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__

Does it look too big ? __eou__ It looks like it was made just for you . __eou__ Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . __eou__ How would you like to pay for it ? __eou__ Here's my credit card . __eou__ Now , if you'll just sign here . __eou__ Yes . Here you are . __eou__ So long .

So , how should we get to the theatre ? __eou__ Let's take the bus . __eou__ I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? __eou__ We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . __eou__ Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ Thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
Alright , tell me what you think . __eou__ Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? __eou__ This dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? __eou__ No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . __eou__ How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ? __eou__ That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__ That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? __eou__ No , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . __eou__ That ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__ If I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__ It ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! __eou__
Let ’ s see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew . __eou__ Ok , every one asks their parents let them stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not everyone-else ’ s father . I think you need be in the house by ten o ’ clock . __eou__ That ’ s absurd . I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that . __eou__ I ’ ll be worried if you stay out late . __eou__ Ok , how about midnight curfew . and I'll let you know where I am . __eou__
I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ I need help turning them on . __eou__ You need change . __eou__ The machines take change ? __eou__ Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer . __eou__ Where do i put the money in ? __eou__ You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on . __eou__ That's it ? __eou__ There's nothing else to it . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else . __eou__
Something's wrong with my computer . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My computer won't turn on . __eou__ Did you see if all the connections are right ? __eou__ I'm not sure I understand what you mean . __eou__ The connections between your CPU and your outlet . __eou__ Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on ? __eou__ If your plugs aren't connected all the way , the computer won't turn on . __eou__ I had no idea . __eou__ Why don't you try it and see what happens ? __eou__ I'll try it right now . __eou__ Let me know if that doesn't work . __eou__

Have you got a minute ? __eou__ Sure . What's up ? __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__ It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__ So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__ Really ? How could you do that ?

I feel like going out . __eou__ I wonder how much of the city is down . __eou__ It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . __eou__ Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__ I have a flashlight in my closet .

When can I move into my new house ? __eou__ The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday . __eou__ Will the utilities be turned on ? __eou__ You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . __eou__ If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . __eou__ I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . __eou__ That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . __eou__ Can you help me on my move-in day ? __eou__ I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . __eou__

I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__ that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256MB . __eou__ then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . __eou__

I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time . __eou__ Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . __eou__

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . __eou__ We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__ I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ We need to find a good realtor . __eou__ Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . __eou__ I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . __eou__ Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . __eou__
Hello , do you know anywhere that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? __eou__ Outlets have cheap cashmere sweaters . __eou__ What a splendid idea ! __eou__ Outlets usually give you great deals . __eou__ Thanks for helping me . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? __eou__ Yes !

We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! __eou__ Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days . __eou__ No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! __eou__
Steven , what are you thinking about ? __eou__ Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . __eou__ That's easy .

Vicky has short hair . __eou__ Well , what about a brooch ? __eou__ Only old women like that . __eou__ Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . __eou__ OK . That's what I can do . __eou__
Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . __eou__ Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . __eou__ She was the head janitor at St .

I prefer beef soup . __eou__ According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . __eou__ Save it until you've served dishes . __eou__ All right . I'll be back right away . __eou__
Do you like reading magazines ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because I think it's boring __eou__ No , you can learn a lot from them . __eou__ Learn a lot ?

Here you are . __eou__

Shall we have some soup first ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . __eou__ Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? __eou__ Meat , I think . __eou__ Don't you like fish then ? __eou__ I do , but I want meat . __eou__ Shall we have some white wine then ? __eou__ Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . __eou__ What would you like for dessert ? __eou__ I just want to have a coffee , I think . __eou__ Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . __eou__
Can you tell me what bus to catch from Altadena to downtown LA ? __eou__ You can catch the 486 . __eou__ That bus goes all the way to LA ? __eou__ I believe so . __eou__ Is the bus ride long ? __eou__ It only takes 45 minutes to an hour . __eou__ That's all ? __eou__ It's a pretty short trip . __eou__ Is there always a lot of people on that bus ? __eou__ It only gets crowded once it gets to LA . __eou__ Oh okay , thank you . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
I am absolutely famished . __eou__ Yeah . I am too . __eou__ Where did you want to go for lunch ? __eou__ I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . __eou__ I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria . __eou__ I actually like the food there . __eou__ Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? __eou__ They have anything you want . __eou__ I was thinking about getting some Chinese food . __eou__ I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria .

This is the house I want to rent . __eou__ Could you tell me the advantages of it ? __eou__ No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city .

Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . __eou__ There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? __eou__ 200 dollars per week . __eou__ In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . __eou__ It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . __eou__ Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . __eou__ Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? __eou__ I agree with you in this way .

What did the boss say ? __eou__ He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? __eou__ You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . __eou__ Don't worry about that .

Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . __eou__ What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? __eou__ I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . __eou__ I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . __eou__

Let ’ s go check it out . __eou__ The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . __eou__ The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant .

As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . __eou__
I can't seem to find the cereal aisle . __eou__ You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods . __eou__ What breakfast foods ? __eou__ They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars . __eou__ Oh , I think I know what you're talking about . __eou__ Can I help you with anything else ? __eou__ Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is ? __eou__ You'll find that by the paper towels . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . __eou__ That's where it'll be . __eou__ Well , thank you very much . __eou__ If you need anything else , please feel free to ask me __eou__

Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . __eou__ Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . __eou__ Good choice !

You're finally here ! What took so long ? __eou__ I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . __eou__ It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . __eou__ I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . __eou__ perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . __eou__ I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ It would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . __eou__

Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? __eou__ It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . __eou__ It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . __eou__
I don't have any more cash , and I have to get on another bus to get home . __eou__ Why don't you have any more money ? __eou__ I wanted some chips at lunch today , so I spent it . __eou__ That was a bright idea . __eou__ I know.Do you have some change I can borrow ? __eou__ You know what ? I don't have any change for you . __eou__ I need to get home . __eou__ Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ? __eou__ I don't have money for a transfer . __eou__ You know ? Go ask for a transfer . They're free . __eou__ Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__

Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees . __eou__ That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls . __eou__ That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__ It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark . __eou__ Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home ! __eou__

I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . __eou__ Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . __eou__ Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . __eou__ Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . __eou__ We'll see .

Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! __eou__
Cute ... Here . These beans are already ground .

I can't wait for step four ! __eou__ There is no step four ... __eou__ Yes , there is , drinking your coffee ! __eou__

The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . __eou__ How does she cook the shrimp ? __eou__ She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . __eou__ I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . __eou__ My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . __eou__ It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . __eou__ Really ? I really want to have a try ! __eou__ Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! __eou__ That sounds like a good idea !

Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__
Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . __eou__ You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . __eou__ What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__ I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... __eou__ And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . __eou__ Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . __eou__ Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__ Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__ I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . __eou__ Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . __eou__ I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? __eou__

I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . __eou__ I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? __eou__ Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . __eou__ We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . __eou__ That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? __eou__ Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? __eou__ I like the red one . What do they eat ? __eou__ You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . __eou__ Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . __eou__ That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . __eou__

Here it is . __eou__
Hello , Elizabeth . How are you ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ Are you sure you're all right ? You look a bit worried today .

Perhaps you can give me some advice . __eou__ Of course , if I can . __eou__ Well , last night when I returned from the theatre , I found that I'd lost my wallet . __eou__ Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? __eou__ Well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos . __eou__ Well , if were you , I'd go to the police station straight away and report it . __eou__ Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly . __eou__ Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ? __eou__ Yes , quite sure . __eou__ I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily , saying when and where you lost it . __eou__ But that takes too long . __eou__ Wait a minute ! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre . I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it . You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , do you have sweaters ? __eou__ This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton . __eou__ You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles . __eou__

Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__

Here is the address . __eou__

That would be better . __eou__ About like this ? __eou__ No , not that much . And yes , that ’ fine . __eou__ Shave also , Sir . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How do you want to your mustache trimmed ? __eou__
My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . __eou__ I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . __eou__ Do you know any places ? __eou__ Well .

I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . __eou__ How much do are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . __eou__ Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . __eou__ It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . __eou__ Anything you need to have in the place ? __eou__ I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . __eou__ You can also check out university bulletin boards . __eou__ Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? __eou__ Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . __eou__ Thank you .

Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? __eou__ Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . __eou__ Wow . You look great . __eou__ Thanks for noticing . __eou__ What type of diet were you on ? __eou__ I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . __eou__ That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? __eou__ Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . __eou__ That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? __eou__ Actually , I'm eating the same amount .

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . __eou__ Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? __eou__ Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . __eou__ We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . __eou__ Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? __eou__ First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . __eou__ I see . What else ? __eou__ We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . __eou__ Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . __eou__ Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . __eou__

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . __eou__ We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__ I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ We need to find a good realtor . __eou__ Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . __eou__ I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has __eou__ Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . __eou__
Here we come . __eou__ Thank you.What ' s the fare ? __eou__ $ 10 . __eou__ How can it be ? __eou__ Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters . __eou__ I see . Thanks for your drive . __eou__
Do you have any seats available ? __eou__ Yes . This way please . __eou__ What's the special today ? __eou__ I recommend our New English Pizza . __eou__ Then give me a large one and an egg drop soup . __eou__ Okay . Wait a minute please . __eou__

Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ? __eou__ Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza . __eou__ Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then . __eou__ Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ? __eou__ If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier . __eou__ I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then ! __eou__ See you tonight . __eou__
It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? __eou__ Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! __eou__ Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! __eou__ Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . __eou__ Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__ When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! __eou__
Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . __eou__ What's the hardware ? __eou__ The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . __eou__ That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ? __eou__ The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . __eou__ I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . __eou__ Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . __eou__ Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . __eou__

I could learn while I watched TV . __eou__ Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . __eou__ No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . __eou__ Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? __eou__ Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . __eou__ Get new friends . __eou__ Why are you always so mean ? __eou__ Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . __eou__ I could help pay for it . __eou__ Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . __eou__ O .

I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . __eou__ I think my arm is broken . __eou__ Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . __eou__ Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . __eou__ Fine with me . I know the laws of the road .

Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? __eou__ Alright . __eou__ It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . __eou__ Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__ Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__ It really hurts . __eou__ Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? __eou__ To hell with you . The accident was your fault . __eou__ I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? __eou__ To hell with you . __eou__

I'd like a business suit made with this material . __eou__ Do you have a particular style in mind ? __eou__ The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . __eou__ I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . __eou__ I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . __eou__ The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? __eou__ Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? __eou__ Next Friday . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__ When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! __eou__

A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . __eou__ It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? __eou__ Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . __eou__ Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . __eou__ I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . __eou__

Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? __eou__ Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . __eou__ You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . __eou__ What's special about these things ? __eou__ Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . __eou__ Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . __eou__
What's the fare , please ? __eou__ Twenty dollars and sixty cents . __eou__ What ? You're overcharging me ! __eou__ No way . Look . That's what the meter says . __eou__ Then something must be wrong with the meter . __eou__

I'm exhausted . __eou__ Okay , let's go home . __eou__
Let's decide what to order . __eou__ I'll have a hamburger . __eou__ The works ? __eou__ No , just tomatoes , please . And large fries . __eou__ Anything to drink ? __eou__ A small cola . __eou__ I'll have a sandwich and small fries . Would you like to have some desserts ? __eou__ Apple pie is my favorite dessert . __eou__ I'd like to have an ice cream __eou__
I want a doggy bag , waiter . __eou__ Sure . How do you like your meal today ? __eou__ Quite good . It was the most wonderful dinner I have ever had . __eou__ I am glad you like it . Welcome next time . __eou__
Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? __eou__ Yes , speaking . __eou__ I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow .

What are we eating for lunch ? __eou__ I have no idea . What about you ? __eou__ I kind of want pizza . __eou__ I ate pizza the other day . __eou__ So , what do you feel like eating then ? __eou__ How about some burgers ? __eou__ I already had a burger yesterday . __eou__ What are we going to do ? __eou__ We can just each get what we want to get . __eou__ That sounds like a plan . __eou__ Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? __eou__ I think they sell both at the cafeteria . __eou__
Hello . My name ’ s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . __eou__ Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ What price range are you interested in ? __eou__ Well , between $ 350-400 a month . __eou__ Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? __eou__ I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . __eou__ When would you like to move in ? __eou__ As soon as possible . __eou__ How about the end of this month ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? __eou__ I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . __eou__ Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . __eou__ Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . __eou__ That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . __eou__
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . __eou__ You're so careless , Billy . __eou__ Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__ I've done it for you . __eou__
In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__ Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__ Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__ Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__ What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__ Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__
May I take your order ? __eou__ I'd like to see the menu , please . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry . I thought you had one . Here you are . __eou__ Don't you have any Chinese food ? __eou__ I'm afraid we don't . But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special . __eou__
Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? __eou__ Sure . Let me get it for you . __eou__ Can you also show me this one ? __eou__ No problem . This one is made of pure gold . __eou__ I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . __eou__ You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful . __eou__ Will the luster fade out after some time ? __eou__ No , we guarantee the quality . __eou__ Ok . Can I try it on ? __eou__ Certainly , the mirror is right here . __eou__
Excuse me . can you tell me where Main Street is ? __eou__ Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No . it ’ s only five minutes walk . you can ’ t miss it . __eou__ Thanks a lot __eou__ You are welcome __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ? __eou__ We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ? __eou__ My son . He is two years old . __eou__ I see , sir . This one is very good . __eou__ Is it ? __eou__ You may rest assured . It sells well . __eou__ May I have a look at the introduction ? __eou__ Certainly . Here it is . __eou__
I want to buy a shirt . __eou__ What color do you like ? __eou__ A white one , please . __eou__ Maybe you could have a look at this one . __eou__ What's the size ? __eou__ Large . __eou__ I think a medium one will do . __eou__
You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . __eou__ Where was it from ? __eou__ It was made in Jingdezhen . __eou__ Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? __eou__ You are right . __eou__ This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . __eou__ It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . __eou__ It must be most precious . __eou__ But it is really worth the price . __eou__
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? __eou__ Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! __eou__
I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing . __eou__ How about this set ? __eou__ Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . __eou__
Wow , Amy , look at that number . __eou__ What's so great about it ? __eou__ What do you mean ? It's a scrim . __eou__ Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . __eou__ I love that kind of stuff . __eou__ Yeah , you seem to like those styles . __eou__ Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk . __eou__ This one looks really expensive though . __eou__ I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it . __eou__ Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke . __eou__ I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week . __eou__ Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary . __eou__ Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ? __eou__ Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . __eou__
Hello . Manchester 6739792 . __eou__ Hello . Is that Nicholas ? __eou__ Nicholas ? Nicholas Nickleby ? No . He doesn't live here any more . He's moved to Morecambe . __eou__ Never ! Do you know his new number ? __eou__ Yes . I've got it somewhere . Let me see . Where did I put it ? Ah - I remember , it's on the memo . Here it is . Do you have a pen to write it down ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Go on . __eou__ His number's 4945939 . __eou__ 4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help . __eou__
I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ? __eou__ How's this one ? __eou__ Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight . __eou__ What about this one ? __eou__ Oh , this is fine . __eou__
your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it online . __eou__ really ? Do you often shop online ? __eou__ yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . __eou__ I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? __eou__ yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . __eou__ sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__ and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__ well , are there any other advantages ? __eou__ yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . __eou__ are there many choices of online shopping ? __eou__ sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . __eou__ perhaps I should have a try . __eou__
My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape . __eou__ I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms . __eou__ Let me know how it works . __eou__ I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster . __eou__ I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo . __eou__ Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos . __eou__

I'll treat you dinner . __eou__ Don't be silly . Let's go Dutch . __eou__
Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . __eou__ It is true . I think we should change some policies . __eou__ Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . __eou__ Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__ Like you and me ! __eou__
I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a dozen tooth brushes , some baby's wipes , and a small bottle of aspirin . __eou__ Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets .

This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium . __eou__ Are they cheaper ? __eou__ This one is 10 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes . __eou__ So if I buy a dozen , I'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Good . I ' ll take a dozen of them then . __eou__ And here is your aspirin . What else did you say you want ? __eou__ Baby's wipes . Johnson's . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Well , actually I'd like to buy some vitamins for my son . He's five months old . Can you suggest any ? __eou__ Sure . Here you are . This one is excellent . Just mix one drop of it with milk . __eou__ Thanks . That'll be all . __eou__
Excuse me , could I have a menu please ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ I want to try the local specialty . Can you recommend me some ? __eou__ Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food . __eou__ Fine , bring us double . __eou__

They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . __eou__ I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . __eou__ Thank you very much and anything else ? __eou__ That's all.Thank you . __eou__
Peter , have you seen my purse ? __eou__ No , mom . I haven't seen it . __eou__ That's strange . It should be on the desk . __eou__ Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ? __eou__ Not yet . Let me see . __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ? __eou__ No . This time I'll try Chinese wine . __eou__ What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head . __eou__ Do people here drink a lot of liquors ? __eou__ Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate . __eou__ Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ? __eou__ Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon . __eou__ Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . ) __eou__ Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on . __eou__ They say that Showing wine tastes quite good . What's it ? __eou__ It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China . __eou__ I see . __eou__ By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine . __eou__ Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . __eou__ I'm always at your service . __eou__

How do you spend your day , Helen ? __eou__ Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon . __eou__ Really ? What time do you go to work ? __eou__ I start work at three . __eou__ And when do you get home at night ? __eou__ I get home pretty late , around midnight . __eou__ So what do you do , exactly ? __eou__ I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT ! __eou__ Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV . __eou__

What game do you like ? __eou__ I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . __eou__ I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . __eou__ It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . __eou__ I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? __eou__ I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . __eou__ Do you play bridge ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . __eou__ I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? __eou__ Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . __eou__ I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours . __eou__
Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ? __eou__ Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ? __eou__ Do you have your receipt with you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ When did you buy it from our store ? __eou__ Four months ago . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . __eou__ But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . __eou__ Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . __eou__ Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Hello , Vicki . __eou__ Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . __eou__ Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . __eou__ I think seven hundred is enough . __eou__ What ? Seven hundred ? __eou__ Well , eight hundred , then ? __eou__ No , one thousand at least . __eou__ Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed ! __eou__ You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right . __eou__ Here you are , sucker ! __eou__ Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! __eou__

There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . __eou__ Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . __eou__ I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . __eou__ Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . __eou__ That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . __eou__ Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . __eou__

Which gate should I go to for the bus ? __eou__ Go to gate number 2 , please . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Driver , take me to the airport . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ Driver , can you please speed up ? I m afraid I might miss the flight . __eou__ I'm sorry , madam , there ’ s a limit to the speed . __eou__ Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . __eou__ I'm sorry about that . What ’ s your flight time ? __eou__ At 2:00 . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , madam . I guess we should get there not later than 1:30 p . m . __eou__ Really ? Great ! __eou__ Here we are . __eou__ Here is the money . __eou__ Just a minute . Here's your change . __eou__

Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section . __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante . __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship . __eou__
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? __eou__ I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . __eou__ What do you think is the biggest change ? __eou__ Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? __eou__ Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . __eou__
Would you like something to drink ? __eou__ Yes please . Do you have any teas ? __eou__ Of course we have lots of teas ? __eou__ What do you recommend ? __eou__ What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ? __eou__ What ’ s this one ? __eou__ That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea . __eou__ Ok , I ’ ll try that . __eou__
Can I have my money back on this skirt ? __eou__ Anything wrong with it ? __eou__ Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . __eou__ Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . __eou__ If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . __eou__ This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . __eou__
May I help you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to buy a shirt . __eou__ What color do you want ? __eou__ I prefer the blue one . __eou__ What size are you ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ? __eou__ No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . __eou__ Can I try it on ? __eou__ Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . __eou__
You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? __eou__ Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s she like ? __eou__ She is beautiful . __eou__ Is she old or young ? __eou__ She is quite young and her hair is blond . __eou__ Is she strict ? __eou__ Not really .

It's a most popular dish . __eou__ I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . __eou__ We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? __eou__ What kind do you have ? __eou__ We have French and Thousand Island . __eou__ Make it Thousand Island . __eou__

Hey honey ! Where were you ? __eou__ I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . __eou__ How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? __eou__ It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . __eou__ Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . __eou__ Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! __eou__ You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! __eou__
Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? __eou__ Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . __eou__ Oh , Would you do me a favor ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . __eou__ Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . __eou__ Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ you are welcome . __eou__
Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . __eou__ Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . __eou__ This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . __eou__ Cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? __eou__ Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? __eou__ Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . __eou__ That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? __eou__ That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__ Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . __eou__ You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? __eou__ I don't think it's broken . __eou__ Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! __eou__ Fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . __eou__
Ah , Oh ! Are you hurt ? __eou__ I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little . __eou__ Maybe I'd better call an ambulance . __eou__ No , don't bother . I think I'm OK . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , it's OK . __eou__
Shall we have some soup first ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . __eou__ Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have , fish or meat ? __eou__ Meat , I think . __eou__ Don't you like fish then ? __eou__ I do , but I want meat . __eou__ Shall we have some white wine then ? __eou__ Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . __eou__ What would you like for dessert ? __eou__ I just want to have a coffee , I think . __eou__ Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . __eou__
How long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Two hours.That area is a little backward . __eou__ I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities . __eou__ You're right . __eou__
My dear , it's five flights up ! __eou__ That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__ We're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__ And there's no one living over us . __eou__ Is the place well-furnished ? __eou__ Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . __eou__ What about the kitchen ? __eou__ The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__ And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__ Are the plumbing all right ? __eou__ The plumbing seems OK , too . __eou__ The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water __eou__ And the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__ The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again . __eou__
I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock . __eou__ Oh , yes , Mrs.Saxton . Please take a seat here . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Would you like a shampoo first ? __eou__ Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . __eou__ Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? __eou__ I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . __eou__ Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date . __eou__ I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . __eou__ sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? __eou__ it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . __eou__ that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? __eou__ I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . __eou__ brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? __eou__ haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . __eou__ why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__ that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . __eou__ here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? __eou__ I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . __eou__ ok , let's go . __eou__
The taxi drivers are on strike again . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline . __eou__ It is really a hot potato . __eou__
I would like to get a bus pass . __eou__ Do you know what kind of pass you want ? __eou__ Can you tell me my options ? __eou__ There are passes for a day , month , and week , and there are student passes . __eou__ I would like the student pass . __eou__ Let me see your student ID . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ How much will it be for the pass ? __eou__ The monthly sticker is $ 24 , but the actual pass is free . __eou__ That'll be fine . __eou__ We appreciate your business . __eou__
Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ I would like to buy two bottles of brandy . __eou__ How about this one ? It's the special local product . __eou__ Can I buy these tax free ? __eou__ Yes . This is a duty-free shop . __eou__

( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? __eou__ Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ To begin with , I have to use chopsticks . __eou__ But you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table . __eou__ Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! __eou__ Anything strange about that ? __eou__ Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__ Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . __eou__
Hi , I'd like to get your store credit card . __eou__ Here's the application form . __eou__ I'm finished . Here's the form . __eou__ Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card . __eou__ Here's my VISA . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! __eou__ Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . __eou__ You mean half-and-half ? __eou__ Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ Let's go ! __eou__
This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think I could fall asleep ! __eou__ Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? __eou__ I'll have whatever you're having . __eou__ OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! __eou__ Well ... the beer sounds good ! __eou__
Did I do well on my driving test ? __eou__ You did a wonderful job . __eou__ So , I passed ? __eou__ Yes , you passed . __eou__ Did I mess up on anything ? __eou__ You did mess up on something . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Your parallel parking isn't all that great . __eou__ Yeah , that's pretty hard for me . __eou__ You just need a little more practice . __eou__ I know , but I still get my license , right ? __eou__ You got it . __eou__
Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? __eou__ There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? __eou__ Great . Let's go . Where is it ? __eou__ Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . __eou__ We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? __eou__ I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . __eou__ So let's go and catch earth worms ! __eou__ OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . __eou__ Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . __eou__ That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today . __eou__ I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ? __eou__ I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one . __eou__ Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . __eou__ Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? __eou__ Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . __eou__
This is the rush hour . __eou__ I notice there's a jam a few blocks away . __eou__ Let's drive off this road . __eou__ I'm afraid I'll be late . __eou__
Jessie , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t come back home for dinner tonight . __eou__ Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . __eou__ You don ’ t have to explain . Suit yourself . __eou__ I apologize .

Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__ I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__ And I suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office doesn't help . __eou__ No , I wouldn't think so . __eou__ I do wish I could lose weight . __eou__ Well , why don't you go on a diet ? __eou__ I've tried diets before but they've never worked . __eou__ Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , could you please tell me the way to Aidan Bookstore ? __eou__ Yes , of course.Would you like to walk there or take a bus ? __eou__ Er ...

Go along this street , on the third cross you'll find it on your left . __eou__ Then I'll walk.Many thanks . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__ It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__ You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! __eou__ Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? __eou__ If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . __eou__ Then I bet he's really good ! __eou__ Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! __eou__

Oh , here it is . __eou__ We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . __eou__ While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . __eou__ Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__ My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . __eou__ Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . __eou__
Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__ I guess you are right . __eou__ Believe me . Everything will be ok . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Hi , are you being helped ? __eou__ No , I'm not . I am interested in some scarves . __eou__ All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ?

I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! __eou__ I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . __eou__ I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . __eou__ How do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . __eou__ Even in the winter ? __eou__ Yes , even in the winter . __eou__ And even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__ I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . __eou__ So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? __eou__ Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . __eou__ Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . __eou__ Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? __eou__ No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . __eou__ I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__

Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ? __eou__ Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . __eou__ Yeah .

If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy . __eou__ Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less . __eou__ Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt . __eou__ All right .

How do you make an omelet ? __eou__ Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__ First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__ OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__

Kinda busy here , Daniel ! __eou__ Dad ? __eou__ Check the drawer . __eou__ OK , got it , but its shape is so strange . I don't like it . __eou__ Can it hold soup ? __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel ! __eou__ Mommy , dinner , please ! __eou__
Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? __eou__ Yes , I do it quite often . __eou__ Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . __eou__ Simple , it's fun . __eou__ How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? __eou__ Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . __eou__ I wouldn't do that . __eou__ But I like the feeling . __eou__
Ahhs ! I'm beat ! __eou__ What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! __eou__ I just got back from fighting the crowds . __eou__ You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? __eou__ Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... __eou__

Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? __eou__ Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . __eou__ Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . __eou__ It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . __eou__ More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . __eou__ And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . __eou__ Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? __eou__ Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . __eou__ I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . __eou__

Wait for a moment , please . __eou__

What're you going to wear today ? __eou__ I like the new shirt . __eou__ You'd better tuck in your shirt . __eou__ Oh , I prefer it loose __eou__
Where is the bus ? __eou__ I think it's running late . __eou__ It should've been here 30 minutes ago . __eou__ It should be coming soon . __eou__ It better , because I'm already late for work . __eou__ I can't stand riding the bus . __eou__ Me too , it's so unreliable . __eou__ That is true . __eou__ It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . __eou__ Exactly.That ' s the worst part . __eou__ I think it's time we started driving . __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__
Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__
Mom , I'm ready for school . __eou__ Don't forger to come straight home after school . __eou__ I know , mom . __eou__ Have you got everything ? __eou__ Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? __eou__

Now let's go home and rest . __eou__ Can't we go to McDonald's first ? __eou__ No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice . __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ And vegetables with porridge . __eou__ Blah ... What's that ? __eou__ This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . __eou__
Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . __eou__ Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . __eou__ I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . __eou__ Is the security door useful ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . __eou__ I totally agree with you .

You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! __eou__ After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it . __eou__ Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? __eou__ These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . __eou__ Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ? __eou__ Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Right . What are you doing over there ? __eou__ I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! __eou__
Could you do me a favor ? __eou__ It depends . __eou__

Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . __eou__ Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! __eou__ But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? __eou__ Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . __eou__ What would happen if they started attacking you ? __eou__ You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . __eou__ I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? __eou__ It's for fun .

How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? __eou__ Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . __eou__ I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! __eou__ This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! __eou__
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ Haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__ Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . __eou__
Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ What would it be like ? __eou__ Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ How many rooms would it have ? __eou__ I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . __eou__ How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ How would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . __eou__ How many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . __eou__
I really want to make something for dinner . __eou__ What are you going to cook ? __eou__ I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . __eou__ A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . __eou__ I don't know how to make that . __eou__ All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . __eou__ That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? __eou__ The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . __eou__ What's next ? __eou__ Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . __eou__ What's the next thing I need to do ? __eou__ Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . __eou__
Could you recommend something to drink ? __eou__ Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . __eou__ We would also like some alcohol before the main dish . __eou__ I think whiskey will be a good choice . __eou__
Are you looking for shoes ? __eou__ Yes , could you give me some ideas ? __eou__ What about this brown one ? __eou__ Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . __eou__
How much should I pay ? __eou__ Let me see . A roasted duck is $ 25 . A plate of pork is $ 6.50 . A bowl of beef is $ 7 . Two bottles of beer are $ 4 . That's a total of $ 42.50 . __eou__ Here is $ 50 . Keep the change , please . __eou__ Oh , sorry sir . We take no tips here . Thank you all the same . __eou__
Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__ Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! __eou__ Nice ! Brunch ! __eou__ Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! __eou__ Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? __eou__ Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . __eou__ Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . __eou__ Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! __eou__

But I'm not very good . __eou__ No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard . __eou__
Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . __eou__ Where did he go ? __eou__ I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . __eou__ Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . __eou__ Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . __eou__ Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . __eou__ In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? __eou__ That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school .

What's wrong with her ? __eou__ Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ You need a babysitter . __eou__ Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . __eou__ I could have Suzy stay at my place . __eou__ I don't want to do that to you , Karen . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . __eou__ I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job .

Then call me and let me know if she's free . __eou__

I can't find the number . __eou__ It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . __eou__

I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ how much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ really ?

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . __eou__ Me ! Me ! __eou__ Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__ Well , OK . But no French kissing ! __eou__ As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! __eou__
Here is the fish counter . Look at the lobsters and crabs . Shall we have some ? __eou__ I'm allergic to these things , you know . __eou__ Sorry , I forgot .

We ’ Ve got enough food . Let ’ s go over to the check-out stand . __eou__ OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by . __eou__

I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__ is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . __eou__
Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house . __eou__ Glad to meet you .

We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . __eou__ Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . __eou__ OK . It's 22 yuan __eou__ Here you are . __eou__
How much does this cost ? __eou__ Sixty dollars . __eou__
I decided to give it a go ! __eou__ Good for you . What items did you bid on ? __eou__ A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! __eou__ Your idol ! Wow !

Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? __eou__ She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . __eou__ That's not bad . What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? __eou__ Three thousand dollars . __eou__ Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? __eou__ He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . __eou__ Well , we can see it for ourselves . Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? __eou__ No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . __eou__

Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . __eou__ I'm OK . __eou__ OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? __eou__ OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__ First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__ OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__ Mm , it is . __eou__ Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? __eou__ Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . __eou__

I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__ Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__ At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__
I think I'll get some new goggles . __eou__ Good idea . I'll get some , too . __eou__ We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ? __eou__ Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays . __eou__ I think I'll get a hat , too . __eou__ No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades . __eou__ Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff . __eou__
in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they __eou__ yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish __eou__ then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__ well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea __eou__ what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend __eou__ well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__
Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ? __eou__ Is Diana in ? __eou__ No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ? __eou__ Yes , please ask her to call John Smith . __eou__ Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message . __eou__

It is an advertisement of the piano training class on the billboard . The place is not far from our home . __eou__ Mom , come on . What are you thinking about ? __eou__ Your sister is in high school now ; no one plays the piano at home . __eou__ Don't tell me you want me to do that ? __eou__ Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there . __eou__ But I don't like playing the piano . And the homework keeps me busy enough . __eou__ Anyway , I will have a look at the piano class after work by myself . __eou__ How depressed ! __eou__
Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair . __eou__ Yes , you do . The Hot Cap is back here in the corner . I think we're ready to put the curlers in . What kind of perm would you like ? __eou__ I just want a light wave . I look really silly if my hair is too curly . __eou__ All right . What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back ? __eou__ Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ? __eou__ Around 30 minutes . __eou__
How do you want your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it the way Peckham wears it . __eou__ Who is Peckham ? __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . __eou__ You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . __eou__ Sure , he is a soccer star . __eou__ Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? __eou__ Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . __eou__ But it's the same hairstyle . __eou__ It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . __eou__ Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . __eou__ He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . __eou__ Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . __eou__ Do it , please . __eou__

The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__ I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . __eou__ So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . __eou__ How long did it take you to do the tiling . __eou__ As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . __eou__ I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__ You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . __eou__
Excuse me , I'm lost . Can you show me where I am in this map ? __eou__ Er , let me see . Oh , look , you're right here . Pretty close to the Olympic Park . __eou__ That's great ! It's not my day . I just have very bad sense of direction . __eou__ Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ? __eou__ I am supposed to go to Liu Ichang . __eou__ Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ? __eou__ Yes . Yes . Can you tell me how to get there ? __eou__ Wow , it is quite far away from here . I'm afraid you're gonna have to take Bus No . 713 . __eou__
Would you pour me some of that tea , please ? __eou__ Okay . Say when . __eou__
The central Hotel , please . I have to be there by 6:00 . __eou__ We shouldn't have any trouble if the traffic isn't too heavy . Is this your first trip here ? __eou__ Yes . I've never been here before . __eou__ You haven't seen the sights yet , have you ? __eou__ No , I'm open to suggestions . __eou__ Why don't you visit the Great Wall first ? __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ Here we are . That will be seven yuan and seventy cents . __eou__ Thanks a lot . Here's ten yuan . Keep the change . __eou__

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ Well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . __eou__

At least 10 drinks . __eou__ Don't you spend a lot of money then ? __eou__ No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays .

We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__ The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__ Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__ It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . __eou__ Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . __eou__ The building is quite new and well constructed .

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Excuse me , how can I get special discount coupons ? __eou__ Buy more and get more special discount coupons . __eou__ Can I get a discount coupon if I buy these goods ? __eou__ Of course You get a coupon for every 3 bags of sugar . __eou__ But how much discount can I get if I use it to buy goods next time ? __eou__ 10 pence off if you use this coupon . __eou__ Can I buy everything in the supermarket by it ? . __eou__ Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date . __eou__ How long can I keep it ? __eou__ The coupon can be used at least one year . __eou__ I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . __eou__ All right . I will get them for you . __eou__
Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? __eou__ The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . __eou__ Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? __eou__ There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there . __eou__ Are the reports favorable ? __eou__ Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese . __eou__ That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__ Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__ I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . __eou__ Sure . There you are . __eou__
Are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ Just a few minutes . I need to make a list of the things that we need . __eou__ Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? __eou__ I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ? __eou__ Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ? __eou__ We don ’ t have enough cash , but I ’ ll take my credit card . __eou__
I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . __eou__ May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? __eou__ You see , there is a run at the neck . __eou__ Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__
That was really a nightmare ! __eou__ Honey , what's up ? __eou__ I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . __eou__ Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__ I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__ Did you panic at the time ? __eou__ A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . __eou__ Was there anyone else with you ? __eou__ Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . __eou__ So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? __eou__ Yes . I have to call the property management . __eou__ For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? __eou__ Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . __eou__ That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . __eou__ I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . __eou__
You look upset , is there anything wrong ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! __eou__ Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . __eou__
Peter , it's time to eat breakfast . __eou__ I am brushing my teeth . __eou__ Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming . __eou__ Mom ~ the toothpaste dropped on my shorts . __eou__ Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts . __eou__
My name is Mary , and I will be your server this evening . __eou__ Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . __eou__ Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out ? __eou__ I would love an appetizer . Are they listed in the menu ? __eou__ We have our daily appetizers listed on the board over there on the wall . __eou__ I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? __eou__ That would be a great choice ! __eou__ I'll trust your taste and take one order of that . __eou__ We have a special where you can order a second appetizer for half price . __eou__ In that case , we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice . __eou__
These vegetables taste very sweet . __eou__ Sure , I planted them . They're organic . __eou__ Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? __eou__ Well , it's a secret . __eou__ Dad , come on !

You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? __eou__ No , Officer , not at all . __eou__ Then how can you explain your behavior ? __eou__ Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer . __eou__ Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? __eou__ Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . __eou__ On a cell phone ? __eou__ Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . __eou__ That ’ s definitely true . I ’ m going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . __eou__
May I use your phone ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__
Excuse me .

Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ? __eou__ I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ? __eou__ I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . __eou__ Probably , Rose .

It is unbelievable . __eou__ Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . __eou__ Seriously ? __eou__ Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . __eou__ Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . __eou__ Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . __eou__ But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body . __eou__

I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? __eou__ Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . __eou__ Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . __eou__ What about cats ? They are more independent . __eou__ Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . __eou__ How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? __eou__ Yeah , are they easy to look after ? __eou__ Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . __eou__

Where's the treasure ? __eou__ It's in a dungeon , under a castle . __eou__ How do you find it ? __eou__ It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
Would you like to have a piece of cake ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm on a diet . __eou__ Why ? You're not fat . __eou__ I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . __eou__ Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ How much do they weigh ? __eou__ All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . __eou__
I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . __eou__ the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? __eou__ I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . __eou__ well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? __eou__ most some drinks have too much sugar in them . __eou__ the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? __eou__ I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? __eou__ unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? __eou__ I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? __eou__ maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . __eou__ maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? __eou__ you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__ that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__ thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . __eou__
Sorry to have smoked in your room . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window . __eou__ It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__ Smoking is harmful for your health . __eou__ I know . I ’ ll try to give it up . __eou__
Are you ready to order yet , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . __eou__ Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . __eou__ Ok . __eou__

OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ Almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? __eou__ Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ Done . So how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! __eou__

You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? __eou__ Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__ I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__ So , how about coming to the department store with me ?

I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? __eou__ That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . __eou__ I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . __eou__ You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . __eou__ Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . __eou__ Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store . __eou__ Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . __eou__ You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . __eou__

That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__

Do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__ I think I'll have a beer . __eou__ ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . __eou__ you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__

Excuse me . I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different , can you tell me how to use them ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Oh , yes . This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone . If you have an IC card , you can insert it into this slot , wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen , and then dial the number of the person you are going to call . __eou__ Well , I see . How to use the other one ? __eou__ First , you pick up the receiver , wait for the dialing signal , dial the number , and then put the coin into the slot , press the ' speak ' button . Then everything is done . __eou__ It seems quite easy . I will try both of them . __eou__
So how long do you plan to live here ? __eou__ We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . __eou__ Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? __eou__ Yes .

Connors , the landlord of our rented house . __eou__ Yeah , What happened ? __eou__ The dishwasher broke down . I had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check . __eou__ And so ... __eou__ She is threatening to evict us for not paying the full rent . __eou__ Hold on , Paula . It does sound pretty serious . But I ’ m sure you can work this out . __eou__ Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ’ re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight . __eou__ Sure , I ’ d be glad to help you straighten things out . Why don ’ t I stop by at about seven thirty ? __eou__ Thanks a million , you are a lifesaver . __eou__

I just moved into my apartment , and the plumbing is not working . __eou__ Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having ? __eou__ The bathtub barely drains at all . __eou__ Okay , the bathroom plumbing needs looking at .

Do you know anything about health food ? __eou__ It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . __eou__ Can you give me some examples ? __eou__ Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . __eou__ Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? __eou__ Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . __eou__

There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . __eou__
Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . __eou__ I stayed with my friends . __eou__ You should at least give me a call . __eou__ I'm sorry , Mum . __eou__

I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . __eou__ Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . __eou__ oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? __eou__ certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique __eou__ it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . __eou__ Yes , Amy , please have some more . __eou__

How can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ Let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Look , traffic jam again ! __eou__
When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ? __eou__ Our school has a link on its website for apartments . __eou__ Can I share an apartment with someone ? __eou__ Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates . __eou__ Are apartments expensive in this city ? __eou__ Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ? __eou__ I want a two-bedroom apartment . __eou__ You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month . __eou__ Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ? __eou__ I love apartment hunting . I ’ ll be happy to go with you . __eou__
Um , hello again . Are you sure you don't want to make a purchase , sir ? __eou__ I have a question . __eou__ Hush ... OK .

Is this taxi taken ? __eou__ No , madam.May I help you ? __eou__ Yes.Will you take me to the station ? __eou__ No problem.Step in , please . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . __eou__ ok , what do you want me to do ? __eou__ first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . __eou__ ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . __eou__ we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . __eou__ while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . __eou__ actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__ my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__ yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . __eou__ keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . __eou__
I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ? __eou__ What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape . __eou__ What about the cotton one ? __eou__ Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . __eou__
Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use . __eou__ OK , it so happened I want to buy one . __eou__ This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . __eou__ I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? __eou__ Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . __eou__
Can you show me some jade , please ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ? __eou__ No , but I do like jade bracelets . __eou__ Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please . __eou__ Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? __eou__ Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ?

What should I get Uncle Teddy ? __eou__ You could get him a tie . __eou__ Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . __eou__ Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . __eou__ That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__ He would think you were crazy , Caroline . __eou__ Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . __eou__ How much do you want to spend ? __eou__ Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__ Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__ What should he have then ? __eou__ I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__ I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? __eou__ I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . __eou__ Alright . We can go later then . __eou__ We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . __eou__ Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? __eou__ She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . __eou__ Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? __eou__ How about the iguana ? __eou__ I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . __eou__ A tie ? __eou__ Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? __eou__ I was just kidding . __eou__

Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 __eou__ Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . __eou__ I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , I am going to meet a client . __eou__ But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! __eou__ I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . __eou__ I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . __eou__ I thought Henry usually did the conferences . __eou__ Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? __eou__ I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . __eou__ No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ?

I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it . __eou__ Why did you stay an extra night in Boston ? What happened ? __eou__ I will tell you tomorrow . See you tomorrow , Mary . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__

I want to go to Tian'anmen Square , you see . __eou__ Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one . __eou__ Would you please let me know when we get there ? __eou__
I really like the way this house looks . __eou__ Yes , it has great curb appeal . __eou__ The landscaping is wonderful ! __eou__ Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . __eou__ Oh , I see what you mean ! __eou__ The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . __eou__ I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls . __eou__ Come and see the kitchen . __eou__ Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink ! __eou__ Let ’ s go check out the bedroom and bathroom . __eou__ I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . __eou__ I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it . __eou__
I'm done . Can I watch TV ? __eou__ Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . __eou__ Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! __eou__ Your throat must be swollen . __eou__ Do I have to take them ? __eou__ Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . __eou__ Yuck ! __eou__ I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . __eou__
You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable ! __eou__
Can you give me a hand , Tom ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Can you open this bottle for me ? The cork seems to be stuck . __eou__ I'll have a go . __eou__
Could you show me some scarves ? __eou__ What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes . __eou__ Show me some of the latest fashion , please . __eou__ At your service . Will this suit you ? __eou__ Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce . __eou__ This is Chinese made . __eou__ Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price . __eou__ But that still sounds expensive . __eou__ Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . __eou__
I came in to see how my home inspection went . __eou__ First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ? __eou__ I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . __eou__ I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . __eou__ The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . __eou__ Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . __eou__ Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? __eou__ The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . __eou__ Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? __eou__ The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . __eou__
How about this floor lamp ? __eou__ Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! __eou__ We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . __eou__ Fine !

Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . __eou__ While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . __eou__ Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! __eou__

Would you like this one ? __eou__ I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ? __eou__ This one ? __eou__ No , the other one ... yes . __eou__ This one is especially built for hard , continuous play .

The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__
The plumbing in my new apartment is not working . __eou__ I need you to tell me what the problem is . __eou__ The bathroom sink is stopped up . __eou__ Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? __eou__ Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . __eou__ Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? __eou__ Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . __eou__ Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? __eou__ I am not sure if I will be home later . __eou__ I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key . __eou__
I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . __eou__ Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . __eou__ I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . __eou__ You eat too much junk food .

Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? __eou__ Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__ I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? __eou__ One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__ When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__ You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . __eou__ What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . __eou__ So I need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__ Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__ Great . Thanks for you advice ! __eou__

OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? __eou__ Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ To the office . I'll be right back . __eou__

I like my bacon very crisp . __eou__ How do you want your eggs ? __eou__ Fried , please . __eou__ Anything more , sir ? __eou__ No , that's enough . T hank you . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market . __eou__ Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ? __eou__ Yes , it's on the third floor . __eou__
Sorry to trouble you . Can you tell me how to get to the City Bank ? __eou__ It's about two or there blocks away from here . __eou__ How long will it take if I walk ? __eou__ It'll take you about 15 minutes . __eou__
I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . __eou__ Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? __eou__ It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . __eou__ That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . __eou__ Do you have any product that controls frizz ? __eou__ With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . __eou__
They must have got in through the kitchen window . __eou__ If only we'd remember to close it . __eou__ I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! __eou__ I wish I'd put it in the bank . __eou__ Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . __eou__ I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . __eou__ I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . __eou__ It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company . __eou__ I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . __eou__
Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ? __eou__ If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . __eou__ Are you going with your friends ? __eou__ No , I'm going alone . __eou__ Oh , aren't you afraid ? __eou__ Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . __eou__ I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . __eou__ Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting . __eou__
Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . __eou__ No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . __eou__ But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . __eou__ I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . __eou__
I will take the coat . Do you receive checks ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Here you are . Please give me a receipt . __eou__ Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . __eou__ OK , please wrap it for me first . __eou__
Excuse me . I bought the CD here two days ago . It's scratched , and doesn't play properly . __eou__ I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one . __eou__ The thing is I've replaced once already . I think it's just a faulty batch . __eou__ I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note . __eou__ Well . To be honest , that's not much use to me . I'll leave the country tomorrow . I'd really prefer a refund . __eou__ OK , sir . I'll see what I can do . __eou__
Is supper ready ? I'm hungry . __eou__ Almost ready . Could you set the table ? __eou__ Ok . What are we having ? __eou__ We'll have fruit salad to start and then the roast beef . __eou__ I'll have my beef well-done , please . By the way , don't we have soup tonight ? __eou__ I didn't prepare it , but if you want , I can cook some . What soup would you like to have ? __eou__ Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ? __eou__ I'll be back late tonight . __eou__ Why ? What's the problem ? __eou__ I have a meeting with my General Manager . __eou__
Hey , Taxi . Over here ! __eou__ Did you call for a car service __eou__ Yes , are you engaged __eou__ Not at the moment . Where would you like me to take you __eou__ I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York . __eou__ Well , it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway . I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour . __eou__ But I can't miss the flight . It's an important meeting and it ’ s waiting for me . __eou__ All right , I will try my best . If there aren ’ t any holdups , I think we can get there in time . __eou__ That's great . How much is it to the airport __eou__ About $ 25 , tips not included . __eou__ Fine .

You're looking very well . __eou__ Thank you . I try to keep in shape . __eou__ Do you often exercise ? __eou__ Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . __eou__ What style of swimming do you like best ? __eou__ I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . __eou__ I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . __eou__ I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? __eou__ Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . __eou__
Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . __eou__ Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . __eou__ Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . __eou__ I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! __eou__ Gee ! You are really strong-willed . __eou__ You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . __eou__ Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . __eou__
How's the chicken ? __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__
How was school today ? __eou__ It was great . I made some friends . __eou__ Really , that's good . __eou__ But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . __eou__ They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . __eou__
Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking ! __eou__ Em , it's delicious ! __eou__ Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__

I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . __eou__ Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . __eou__ Not really . It pinches my toes . __eou__ I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . __eou__ I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . __eou__ Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__
Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? __eou__ Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary . __eou__ You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . __eou__ Can I return the car in San Francisco ? __eou__ San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . __eou__ Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . __eou__ No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . __eou__ Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that . __eou__ Do you still want the car , sir ? __eou__ Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . __eou__ It's a beautiful drive . __eou__ Where are the keys ? __eou__ Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . __eou__
I'm not sure , is this our stop ? __eou__ Yeah , get off the bus . __eou__ Do you have any idea where we are ? __eou__ I'm really not sure . __eou__ This can't be the right stop . __eou__ I don't think this is right . __eou__ We got off too early , didn't we ? __eou__ Yeah , we did get off too early . __eou__ I should've just stayed on the bus . __eou__ I messed up . __eou__ Great , we have to walk now . __eou__ You want to wait for the next bus ? __eou__
Miss , where do you want to go ? __eou__ Could you drop me off at the airport ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? __eou__ Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice . __eou__ Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage . __eou__ I'm afraid that a button is missing . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . __eou__ OK , please . __eou__ Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ? __eou__ Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . __eou__ It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . __eou__ It's been several days now , I am not sure . __eou__ Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go . __eou__ Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? __eou__ I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . __eou__ OK , I will . __eou__ This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service . __eou__
Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane . __eou__ Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ OK , I ’ ll be right back . __eou__
I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size . __eou__ It's a small . __eou__ How is the condition ? How old is it ? __eou__ It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it . __eou__ Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? __eou__ I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! __eou__
Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . __eou__ Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? __eou__ Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . __eou__ So this would be your first automobile ? __eou__ That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . __eou__ Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . __eou__ Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . __eou__ So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . __eou__ I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . __eou__
What a mess , Jack ! __eou__ I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad . __eou__ You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up . __eou__
Hi , may I get you anything to drink ? __eou__ Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ? __eou__ Would you like an appetizer ? __eou__ May I get an order of barbeque wings ? __eou__ Sure , would you like anything else ? __eou__ That'll be fine for now , thank you . __eou__ Okay , tell me when you want to order the rest of your food . __eou__ Excuse me . I'm ready to order . __eou__ What would you like ? __eou__ Let me have the baby-back ribs . __eou__ Sure , will there be anything else that I can get you ? __eou__ That will be it for now . __eou__
Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! __eou__ Coming ! __eou__
I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? __eou__ I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? __eou__ I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . __eou__ new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . __eou__ do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? __eou__ that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? __eou__ yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . __eou__ I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . __eou__ I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . __eou__ ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . __eou__
It's time for bed . __eou__ I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . __eou__ It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . __eou__ I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . __eou__ Why don't you try counting sheep ? __eou__ I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . __eou__ That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . __eou__ Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? __eou__ If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . __eou__ I promise I'll go to sleep soon . __eou__ No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . __eou__ See you in the morning . __eou__
What did you cook ? __eou__ Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__ Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? __eou__ Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! __eou__ This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! __eou__ Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . __eou__ This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! __eou__ Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! __eou__ Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! __eou__ Want some more ? __eou__ I'm stuffed ! __eou__
Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . __eou__ Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . __eou__ Will you have it later ? __eou__ I think so.Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . __eou__ That's terrific.Thank you . __eou__
I like to drive on freeway . __eou__ Don't drive too fast . __eou__ Don't worry.There ' re few cars now . __eou__ Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast . __eou__
I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . __eou__ I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__ I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . __eou__ Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? __eou__ I smoke around 30 each day . __eou__ Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . __eou__ If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . __eou__ Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . __eou__ I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . __eou__ Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . __eou__
Welcome , how may I help you today ? __eou__ I'm ask for a pizza , please . __eou__ Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one . __eou__ You're right , that is great . __eou__ What size would you like ? __eou__ Medium one will be perfect , thank you __eou__ Which kind do you want ? __eou__ I like seafood on my pizza . __eou__ We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab . __eou__ Tuna sounds good today . __eou__ Would that be for here or take away ? __eou__ That would be to go . __eou__ That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
What's the matter ? __eou__ Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? __eou__ Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . __eou__ Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? __eou__
What's the matter ? __eou__ Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? __eou__ Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . __eou__ Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? __eou__ It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . __eou__

I'm really not all that tired . __eou__ You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . __eou__ It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now . __eou__ Just close your eyes , and try not to think . __eou__ That really does not work for me . __eou__ It doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep . __eou__ How about I tire myself out , and then fall asleep when I'm tired ? __eou__ Then you're not going to go to sleep . __eou__ Don't worry , I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while . __eou__ I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams . __eou__ Fine . Sleep well yourself . __eou__
What's today's special ? __eou__ I think our smoked fish will be to your taste . __eou__ OK , I'd like to try it today . __eou__

That might help you . __eou__ I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . __eou__ That ’ s correct . __eou__

I like something unusual . __eou__ This gift is the best for a man who has everything . __eou__ Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . __eou__
This skirt is too tight . I would like to return it please . Do I need to go to the customer's service desk ? __eou__ I can help you with that . Do you still have your receipt ? __eou__ No , I receive this as a birthday present , but the price tag is still on the skirt though . Will that be OK ? __eou__ Oh , yes , that will help me a lot . __eou__ Do you have any more skirts in this style ? I would like to find a size larger . __eou__ I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ? __eou__ No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else . __eou__ Well , your refund total is 50 dollars . __eou__
Jim , could you do me a favor ? __eou__ Sure , just ask . What can I do for you ? __eou__ My car has a problem starting . Could you please take a look at it for me ? __eou__ No sweat .

Could you change this note for me , please ? __eou__ Yes . How would you like it ? __eou__ Eight tens , six ones and large silver for others . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ It's OK . __eou__
Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . __eou__ Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? __eou__ We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . __eou__ What's my other option ? __eou__ Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . __eou__ That's fine . I'll do that then . __eou__ Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . __eou__

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . __eou__
There's going to be a highway here . __eou__ That's better . __eou__ The traffic problem will soon be eased . __eou__ I think so . __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! __eou__
How far do we have to go ? __eou__ About 50 miles . __eou__ The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . __eou__ No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . __eou__ But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Right . __eou__
You'd like coffee , wouldn't you ? __eou__ I think I'd rather have tea this morning . __eou__ What else are you going to have ? __eou__ Just an English muffin . What are you going to have ? __eou__ That sounds good . I'm going to order the same thing . __eou__
Can you put me through to May Flower Restaurant , please ? __eou__ Just a second ... Sorry , the line is engaged . __eou__ OK , I ’ ll try later . Thanks anyway . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Next please . __eou__ I want to send this letter to the US by airmail . __eou__ That'll be five yuan forty , please . __eou__
You are late . __eou__ I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection . __eou__ Couldn't get connection ? __eou__ Yes , your number is out of service . __eou__ Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . __eou__ It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service . __eou__
Is there a vacant table for two now ? __eou__ Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please . __eou__ Well , we would like to sit over there . Is that all right ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__
Excuse me , I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . Can you tell me where those are ? __eou__ Right over here , sir . What size do you wear ? __eou__ Medium . __eou__ These here are all mediums . __eou__ Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're a present for a friend . __eou__ Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
It's your turn now , Helen . __eou__ OK . I'm coming . __eou__ This is your song . I picked it for you . __eou__ Thank you . You are so considerate . __eou__ Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . __eou__ OK . This key is too high for me . __eou__ I think it's a piece of cake for you . __eou__ OK . Let me have a try ... __eou__ Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . __eou__ Thank you . I'm sure you will . __eou__ I hope so . Thank you for saying so . __eou__
I want to buy some meat . __eou__ What kind would you like ? __eou__ I want one pound of ground beef . __eou__ That's going to be about $ 2.48 . __eou__ That will be fine . __eou__ What else can I get for you ? __eou__ Let me also have three pounds of chicken breasts . __eou__ That's going to be $ 4.05 a pound . __eou__ Can you tell me the total cost of the chicken breasts ? __eou__ That will be $ 12.15 . __eou__ That's all I'm going to get today . __eou__ That's fine . Let me get your meat . __eou__
Hi . I need to have my shoes repaired . __eou__ What ’ s the matter with them ? __eou__ Look at the heels . They are slanting . __eou__ Ah , I can do it perfectly . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ 6 yuan . And I can make them as new as before . __eou__ I think it ’ s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ’ ll go to another B . __eou__ All right . I ’ ll repair them for you . __eou__ How long will it take ? Could you repair them while I wait ? __eou__ Yes . They will be ready in a few minutes . __eou__ Great ! I ’ ll just sit here and wait . __eou__

Everything would be ready in a minute . __eou__ Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty . __eou__ Here you are . Here you go . We have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , French fries and icecream for dessert . Eating chicken while it's hot . it tastes better . __eou__ Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . __eou__ Here you are . Taste the French fries . __eou__ They're soft . __eou__ Would you like some more ? __eou__ No more , thank you . __eou__ Here is to our friendship and health ! __eou__ Bottom is up . __eou__
Would you please wrap the shoes first ? I would like to buy a sweater . __eou__ Sure . Take your time . __eou__ How much does the green one cost ? __eou__ $ 80 . __eou__ OK . I will take it as well . How much in all ? __eou__
John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . __eou__ Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . __eou__ Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . __eou__ Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . __eou__ Would you like to clear the table then ? __eou__ Really ? Do I have to do it ? __eou__ Not , if you don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? __eou__ Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? __eou__ No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . __eou__

Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__
It's time for bed . __eou__ But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? __eou__ It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . __eou__ I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . __eou__ Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . __eou__ Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . __eou__ You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . __eou__ An excellent idea . Work now and play later . __eou__ I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . __eou__ No , now it's bedtime . __eou__
I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . __eou__ You must have bought many things in the mall ? __eou__ Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . __eou__ It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . __eou__ I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . __eou__ You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . __eou__
Can I ask a favor of you ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__

Tell me ! Would you ? __eou__
Honey , I need to have a talk with you . __eou__ Dad , I have to do my homework . __eou__ No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? __eou__ Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . __eou__ Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . __eou__ I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . __eou__
Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ? __eou__ One Big Mac and French Fries . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ Give me one coke , please . __eou__ Is this to go or to eat here ? __eou__ To go , please . __eou__ That comes to four dollars and ten cents . __eou__ And can I have some ketchup , please ? __eou__ It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself . __eou__

I'm glad these batteries are on sale . __eou__ I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . __eou__ But that's what the ad said . __eou__ I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . __eou__ Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . __eou__ Yes , many people make that mistake . __eou__ Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . __eou__ You're right . Many ads are like that . __eou__ Well , as long as I'm here . __eou__ Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . __eou__
May I try on this pair of shoes ? __eou__ Of course . What is your size ? __eou__ I think it's 35 . __eou__ OK .

I'll take this one . __eou__
Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? __eou__ Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... __eou__ No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? __eou__ Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . __eou__ You're not coming ? __eou__ Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . __eou__ Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? __eou__ We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . __eou__ I'm sorry , Mom . __eou__ Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you . __eou__ I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best . __eou__ I know . Goodnight . __eou__
Traffic rules are different among countries . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ People drive on the right in China . __eou__ Oh , that's interesting ! __eou__
I am so busy today . __eou__ Can I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . __eou__ I ’ ll be glad to help . __eou__ Or maybe make the beds . __eou__ All you have to do is ask for help . __eou__ Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! __eou__ I ’ m ready and willing to help . __eou__
Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? __eou__ Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__ That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__ Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__ True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . __eou__ Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . __eou__ Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . __eou__ That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__ I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . __eou__
what can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ What do we get this morning ? __eou__ Fruit juice , cake and refreshments and everything . __eou__ I ’ d like to a glass of tomato juice please . __eou__ Any serial , sir ? __eou__ Yes . A dish of cornmeal weight . __eou__ And eggs ? __eou__ Yes . Baked eggs and buttered toast . I like my baker very crazy . __eou__ How do you want to your eggs ? __eou__ Fried , please . __eou__ Anything more , sir ? __eou__ No , that ’ s enough , thank you . __eou__
What shall we do today ? __eou__ We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow . __eou__ Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ? __eou__ What an excellent idea ! __eou__ Shall we do some jogging ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ I feel well now . __eou__ Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . __eou__ Quite right . __eou__
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . __eou__ He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ And the host announced that he won it all ! __eou__
Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . __eou__ Oh , that hurts . __eou__ I think it's bleeding . __eou__
What shall we do tonight ? __eou__ How about the cinema ? __eou__ That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . __eou__ What would you suggest to see ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know.It depends . __eou__

Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States . __eou__ So what about the tennis racket ? __eou__ Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! __eou__ How much did that end up costing you ? __eou__ Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it ! __eou__ Hey , two for one . That's a super deal . __eou__ And here's her signature ! __eou__
Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does . __eou__ Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ’ Ve had her longer than we ’ Ve had our dog . __eou__ She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! __eou__ I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . __eou__ Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ? __eou__ She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . __eou__ Have you ever thought about having another pet ? __eou__ The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat ! __eou__

I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . __eou__ Okay , they'll be ready for you in an hour . __eou__
Yes , ma'am ? __eou__ How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ? __eou__ Air mail or surface mail ? __eou__ Air mail , please . __eou__ That'll be eighty-five cents . __eou__ Four stamps , please . How much is that ? __eou__ Three dollars and forty cents . __eou__ There you go . __eou__
Hey ! Taxi . __eou__ Where are you heading , sir ? __eou__ Capital Airport . __eou__ What's your flight time ? __eou__ At 7:50 . __eou__ I guess we should get there no later than 7:00 . __eou__ How long is the ride from here then ? __eou__ Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ? __eou__ Yes , that'll be fine . How much is this going to cost ? __eou__
What do you want to eat for breakfast ? __eou__ All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast . __eou__ You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ? __eou__ I sometimes run late in the morning , and can't make breakfast . __eou__ That's not a good excuse . __eou__ Tell me what you eat in the morning . __eou__ I just eat some oatmeal , toast , and orange juice . __eou__ That sounds like a great breakfast . __eou__ It's good , and it's easy to make . __eou__ That sounds like a very quick meal . __eou__ So , are you still going to have cereal ? __eou__ I think I'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast . __eou__

My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? __eou__ Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . __eou__ I wish my parents were a little more lenient . __eou__ I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__ You like going to bed early ? __eou__ I don't like being too tired the next day . __eou__ Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__ If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . __eou__
Good morning , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ Good morning . I need a new identification card . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ My ID card is lost . __eou__ OK , did you bring your household register or residence booklet ? __eou__ I only have my household register . __eou__ It doesn't matter , they are the same thing . __eou__ Here you are , sir . What do I do next ? __eou__ OK , I will register you in our database system .

You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . __eou__ What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? __eou__ No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . __eou__ I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . __eou__ How long before I find out what their decision is ? __eou__ By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . It will go quickly . __eou__

In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . __eou__ You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' __eou__

Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? __eou__ I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . __eou__ I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . __eou__ And what does your husband do ? __eou__ My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . __eou__ But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . __eou__ Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper .

it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ what kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise .

What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! __eou__

I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . __eou__ Wow ! That's interesting !

I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that .

This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ Okay , I'll follow your advice . __eou__

Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . __eou__ Tell me what seems to be the problem . __eou__ My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . __eou__ Did you ever talk to him about it ? __eou__
Do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit . __eou__

That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop .

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__
Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . __eou__ Let me help you . __eou__ Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ I think I should be more careful next time . __eou__

But it is on the other side of the lights . __eou__ OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? __eou__ You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . __eou__ And do I take that road ? __eou__ Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . __eou__ Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? __eou__ Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Does this TV work well ? __eou__ Yes , it is almost new here . __eou__ Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ? __eou__ It is a color TV . You know , the rich people like the digital one now . So they have no room for them . __eou__

From the looks of this house from the outside , I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside . __eou__ From here , it does look like it could use a little work .

It is listed as roomy and spacious . __eou__ Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? __eou__ The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite .

This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . __eou__ You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? __eou__ Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . __eou__ With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . __eou__ Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . __eou__

Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__

How long did you want the place ? __eou__ Six months . __eou__ Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases . __eou__ Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon . __eou__ Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go . __eou__ Just let me look at it quickly . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Looks like a standard lease . __eou__ Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit .

I'm good at shooting . __eou__ Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . __eou__ Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? __eou__ Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . __eou__ Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . __eou__ No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . __eou__ Really ? You must be ... __eou__ But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . __eou__ That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . __eou__ Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . __eou__ He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . __eou__

Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . __eou__ So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? __eou__ I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . __eou__ junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . __eou__ But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . __eou__ Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it . __eou__ Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring . __eou__ Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit . __eou__ Well , that sounds better than giving it up . __eou__
You sure are buying a lot of things online . __eou__ Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . __eou__ What are the advantages of buying online ? __eou__ Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . __eou__ The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . __eou__
I can't find proper parking space . __eou__ Let's just park here . __eou__ No , there's no parking sign . __eou__ Oh , the policeman's coming . __eou__

The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . __eou__ buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea .

They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ was it very old house ? __eou__ it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ is it in a good location ? __eou__ the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__

Have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ? __eou__ We just moved in yesterday , actually . __eou__ So , what do you think about the place ?

It has a lot of history ! __eou__ Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? __eou__ It's just off of the ring road . __eou__ Do you have a big yard ? __eou__ It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . __eou__ Is your house well-lit ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . __eou__ How many rooms does your house have ? __eou__ Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend . __eou__ I'd be up for that ! __eou__
Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__ My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__ Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ You need a babysitter . __eou__ Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . __eou__ I could have Suzy stay at my place . __eou__ I don't want to do that to you , Karen . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . __eou__ I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . __eou__ I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . __eou__ I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . __eou__ I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__ I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__ Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . __eou__
May I have a look at that vase , please ? __eou__ Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . __eou__ Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? __eou__
What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . __eou__ And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! __eou__
Could I have the check , please ? __eou__ Okay . I'll just be a minute . __eou__
it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! __eou__ we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__ that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? __eou__ sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__ that would be lovely , thanks . __eou__ do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . __eou__ ok . What do you think about our living room ? __eou__ well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . __eou__ my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . __eou__ oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . __eou__ your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming . __eou__ I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . __eou__ that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot . __eou__

I'd like to purchase a pan . __eou__ Is there any particular size that you want ? __eou__ Well , I cook a lot of big meals . __eou__ What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan . __eou__ Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . __eou__ Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . __eou__ Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . __eou__ No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . __eou__ Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . __eou__ I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? __eou__ Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . __eou__
I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it . __eou__ We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? __eou__ The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street . __eou__ Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? __eou__ That's why I think it may suit my needs . __eou__ I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . __eou__ The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? __eou__ Yes . But not including the utilities . __eou__ Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? __eou__ I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . __eou__ Oh , that's no problem . __eou__
I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen . __eou__ high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . __eou__ It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__ What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? __eou__ It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . __eou__ It's a bit small but looks nice . __eou__ What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . __eou__
I'm sorry I scratched your car . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count . __eou__
I want to have the overcoat made to measure . __eou__ Sure , sir . Have you brought the cloth ? __eou__ No , I don't know which one to choose . I think maybe you can help me . __eou__ Well , I recommend you to choose the 100 % cotton . __eou__ I will take your advice . __eou__

The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ? __eou__ I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch . __eou__

Good luck . __eou__
