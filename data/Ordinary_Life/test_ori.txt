Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on .

Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . __eou__ Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . __eou__ Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama .

Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? __eou__ Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . __eou__ Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . __eou__ That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . __eou__ What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . __eou__ So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . __eou__ Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . __eou__ After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . __eou__
Why didn ’ t you call me last night ? __eou__ Because I went out . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? __eou__ I didn ’ t have any change . __eou__ Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . __eou__ I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why . __eou__

When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . __eou__

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Can I have a look at your handworks ? __eou__ All right .

Let's go to Wangfujing by bus . __eou__ Better take the subway . It's faster , and more convenient . __eou__ OK , it will be a new experience for me . __eou__ We have a rather comprehensive subway system here .

Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . __eou__ Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ? __eou__ Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . It's free fo charge .

Morgan , can I ask you a question ? __eou__ sure , what is it ? __eou__ I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . __eou__ in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon . __eou__ what happen to all the leftover food ? __eou__ it usually goes to the dump . __eou__ that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? __eou__ ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . __eou__ I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . __eou__ well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . __eou__ no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ... __eou__ I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . __eou__ many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK . __eou__ did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you . __eou__ that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! __eou__

So what do you think of my new dress ? __eou__ I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes .

I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? __eou__ I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . __eou__ Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? __eou__ I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . __eou__

Do you buy a daily paper ? __eou__ I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper .

I feel like having something mild for dinner __eou__ In that case , what about having some noodles ? __eou__ Noodles are fine . Or maybe I'll have some porridge . __eou__ All right . I'll cook for you . __eou__
Want to send out for some Chinese ? __eou__ Some what ? __eou__ Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . __eou__ No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? __eou__ Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . __eou__ Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? __eou__ Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . __eou__ What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . __eou__
I've never been to a restaurant like this before . __eou__ It's really different , isn't it ? __eou__ That's a good word to describe it . __eou__ I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . __eou__ I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . __eou__ Well , let's order one for starters . __eou__ I'm in the mood for a Californian . __eou__ That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . __eou__
Do you have this design with only one breast pocket ? __eou__ Let me see.Oh , we have the design but not the same color as this one . __eou__ It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . __eou__ Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . __eou__ Show me some classic high heels , please . __eou__ Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? __eou__ Black . Classic . __eou__ Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . __eou__ Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . __eou__ OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . __eou__ I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Seven-and-a-half . __eou__ Here we are . How does it fit ? __eou__ Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo __eou__ Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . __eou__

Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? __eou__ Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ? __eou__ Let's have four coffees , please . __eou__ OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks . __eou__ Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here . __eou__

It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . __eou__ I'm sure they are wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . __eou__ Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there . __eou__ Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ? __eou__ Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road .

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . __eou__ Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? __eou__ Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . __eou__ We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . __eou__ Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? __eou__ First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . __eou__ I see . What else ? __eou__ We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . __eou__ Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . __eou__ Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . __eou__

I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ What ? Why ? __eou__ Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . __eou__ I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . __eou__ I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . __eou__ Good luck with that ! __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm watching TV . __eou__ Are there any good programs on TV ? __eou__ Tingling is on TV . __eou__ Which Channel is it ? __eou__ Channel 8 . __eou__ It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? __eou__
Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . __eou__ Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . __eou__ No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . __eou__ Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . __eou__ How far is that ? __eou__ It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . __eou__ According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . __eou__ That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . __eou__ Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! __eou__ Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . __eou__ Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? __eou__ The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? __eou__ 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . __eou__ We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . __eou__
Can I also take the MET to get there ? __eou__ Yeah sure , it's much quicker . Do you know how ? __eou__ No , can I trouble you to lend me a hand ? __eou__ Ok , not a problem . Let's go to the station . __eou__ You have to buy a ticket first . You want to go to Shi Da , right ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Ok , then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station . __eou__ Where is that ? __eou__ Look at the map to see where you are . Then look at where you want to go . The number is how much money you have to pay . __eou__ Oh , that's simple enough . __eou__ Then , when you have your ticket , you go wait on the platform . __eou__ Anything else I should know ? __eou__ Just remember to hold on to your ticket . You need it to get out of the station when you get there . __eou__

I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . __eou__ Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? __eou__ I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . __eou__ I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . __eou__ Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . __eou__ Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . __eou__

Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? __eou__ I just need a one-bedroom apartment . __eou__ That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . __eou__ Would you come with me to look at apartments ? __eou__ I would be happy to look at apartments with you . __eou__
Why do you stop me ? __eou__ You have gone against the traffic rules . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ Do you know this is a Onaway street ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ You have to pay a fine . __eou__

How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__

Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . __eou__ They spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ Isn't that complicated ? __eou__ No , it's easy .

A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . __eou__ Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? __eou__ I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! __eou__ Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! __eou__

John , it ’ s time to get up . __eou__ It can ’ t be time to get up yet . __eou__ It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__ What ’ s the time ? __eou__ It ’ s nearly half past seven . __eou__ My watch says ten past . __eou__ It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__ Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__ Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__ It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . __eou__ I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . __eou__
Why is the car before us stopping ? __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . __eou__ More and more people easily get irritated while driving . __eou__ Yes . This is what is called road rage . __eou__
What do you think of this flat ? __eou__ It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . __eou__ Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think . __eou__ But there's no hot water after 10 at night . Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . It feels good . __eou__ That's true . But I love the living room ; it's huge and filled with sunshine . __eou__ True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . __eou__ It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__ You're right . The view is spectacular . But that bedroom is so small . We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__ Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff . __eou__ I haven't thought of that . __eou__
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . __eou__ A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__
Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? __eou__ Sure . May I take your measurements ? __eou__ Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . __eou__ I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? __eou__ The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? __eou__ Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? __eou__ That's fine , thank you . __eou__
Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to see some coats . Would you recommend me some of them ? __eou__ Sure . Come to look at these styles .

Do you have this coat in yellow ? __eou__ Yes , I will find one for you . Here you are . It's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft . __eou__ It looks nice . __eou__ Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on . __eou__

Can you get it yourself ? It ’ s in the refrigerator . __eou__ Ok . Would you like a drink too ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll have an ice tea . You ’ ll see it next to the lemonade . __eou__ Are you having any dessert ? __eou__ I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . __eou__
Bring me some toast , please . __eou__ Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? __eou__ Spread some jam , please . __eou__ Anything to drink ? __eou__ Black coffee is fine . __eou__
