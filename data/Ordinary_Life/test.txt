But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __sou__ You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .
