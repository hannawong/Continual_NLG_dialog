Excuse me , driver . Let me off here , please . __eou__ Well , it's not the supermarket you want . __eou__ I have just changed my plan . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Here is the fare and keep the change please . __eou__

I have never seen such a popular book before . __eou__ Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . __eou__ You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . __eou__

You want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . __eou__ Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ Uh ... no . __eou__

Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? __eou__ Give me a shot of whisky and soda . __eou__ With or without ice , sir ? __eou__ Certainly without ice .

Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . __eou__ No kidding ! When did that happen ? __eou__ Early this morning . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . __eou__ Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? __eou__ The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . __eou__ That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! __eou__
Well , I ’ d like to have my coat to order.Will you take my measurements ? __eou__ Certainly.How do you like to have it made ? __eou__ Make it after the present fashion , please.What if it does not fit ? __eou__ You may rest assured . __eou__ When can I expect to have it ? __eou__ By the end of next week . __eou__ Ok then .

What kind of place shall we rent ? __eou__ It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . __eou__ Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . __eou__ Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . __eou__ I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . __eou__ Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__ Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . __eou__ How much do you think the rent will be ? __eou__ I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . __eou__
Where is our son , dear ? __eou__ He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school . __eou__ What happened ? Have you talked with him ? __eou__ Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor . __eou__
Good morning , I want to send this parcel to Taiwan . __eou__ Airmail or surface mail ? __eou__ How long would surface mail take , compared with airmail ? __eou__ Oh , anything up to 3 or 4 months for surface mail . It depends on the sailing of the ships . Airmail would only take 1 to 2 weeks . __eou__ How much would this parcel cost me by airmail ? __eou__ Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 . __eou__ Thanks . That'll be OK . __eou__

I want to buy a wallet . __eou__ Here are all the wallets with various designs . How about this one ? It is quite fashionable . __eou__ May I pick it up ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Do you have one of better quality ? __eou__ This one is much better , but it is also much more expensive . __eou__ There is no problem about the price . How much is it ? __eou__ Two hundred and thirty-five yuan . __eou__ OK , I'll take it . __eou__
Hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . What exercises are you going to do today ? __eou__ I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless . __eou__ Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . __eou__ Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time . __eou__ Sure . Is today only you second visit ? __eou__ Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape . __eou__ The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later . __eou__ I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly . __eou__ That's right . You don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ... __eou__
Did you get your bus pass ? __eou__ I haven't gone to get it yet . __eou__ Why haven't you got it ? __eou__ I don't know where to go to get one . __eou__ I know where to get them from . __eou__ Where do I get it ? __eou__ They sell them at the business office on campus . __eou__ I had no idea . __eou__ I'm sure you didn't . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ I'll buy it later on today . __eou__

The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other . __eou__ What should I do ? __eou__ You go figure it out yourself . __eou__ Got it , Mom . __eou__ OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . __eou__ Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it . __eou__ Danny , back to your position . Move ! __eou__ OK . Bingo ! We win .

I'd like to see a tea set , please ? __eou__ How about the Japanese ones ? __eou__ They're OK , but I prefer chinese ones . __eou__ Oh , I see . I'll show you some . __eou__
Do you have any hats ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I'll show you several kinds . __eou__ I like both of the two hats . Can you give me a discount if I buy both of them __eou__ Sure , we'll take 20 % off the price . __eou__ I like this colour and it is very bright . __eou__ This color is becoming to you , too . __eou__ Yes , I think so . How much are they ? __eou__ The pink one is 30 yuan , and the purple one is 35 yuan . __eou__
What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! __eou__
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather it for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It's a private garden . __eou__
Are you through with your meal ? __eou__ Yes , we are . Could we have the check , please ? __eou__ Here is your check , 86 dollars in all . Can I take care of it here when you are ready ? __eou__ Do you accept checks ? __eou__ No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . __eou__ Well , I don't have any cash with me , so I ’ ll have to put it on credit . __eou__ I'll be right back . __eou__ Ok , please wait a minute . Can I have my food packaged ? __eou__ I see . I'll bring some to-go boxes for you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
are you good at cooking ? __eou__ no , but I'm pretty good at eating ! __eou__ do you prefer chinese food or Western food ? __eou__ well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food . __eou__ are you used to the food here ? __eou__ I'm not really used to it yet . __eou__ what's your favorite Chinese dish ? __eou__ like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day . __eou__ have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ? __eou__ I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . __eou__ you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression . __eou__ that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . __eou__ if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes . __eou__ that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! __eou__ if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! __eou__
Have you ever tried shopping online ? __eou__ No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . __eou__ That's right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . __eou__ That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . __eou__ What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . __eou__ It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . __eou__ I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? __eou__ Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce ) Here you are . Can get you anything else ? __eou__ I'm fine for now , thanks . __eou__
I'm hungry . __eou__ You already ate . __eou__ It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . __eou__ There's nothing left from dinner . __eou__ I'm going to get a snack . __eou__ What kind of snack are you going to make ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ You can always make a sandwich . __eou__ I don't know what kind of sandwich I want . __eou__ Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . __eou__ I may just do that . __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__
Excuse me , would you like a drink before your meal ? __eou__ Pardon me ? __eou__ Would you like a drink ? __eou__ Oh , I see . I'll have a beer please __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__ Thank you . How much is it ? __eou__ Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge . __eou__ Are you sure ? Then I'd love more beer please __eou__ Don't worry . It would be back again a little later . __eou__ Are you finished ? __eou__ Yes , may I have some more beer ? __eou__ Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute . __eou__
Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again . __eou__ Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today . __eou__ I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class . __eou__ How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ... __eou__ Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me . __eou__
What's wrong , officer ? __eou__ You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? __eou__ I did ? __eou__ You didn't see the red light ? __eou__ I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . __eou__ Didn't you learn that red means stop ? __eou__ I know that . __eou__ Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ I'm giving you a ticket for this . __eou__ I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . __eou__ Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . __eou__
What do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . __eou__ I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ Really ? I thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ Sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . __eou__ How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . __eou__ That ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ Here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ Let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . __eou__ This is perfect ! What do you think ? __eou__ I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! __eou__ I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! __eou__
Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . __eou__ Yes , this is a very popular car . __eou__ I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? __eou__ The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price . __eou__ You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . __eou__ 50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee . __eou__ I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . __eou__ Then what price would be fair to you ? __eou__ I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . __eou__ I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . __eou__ Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . __eou__ 38000yuan is my final offer . __eou__ Hum ... OK . I will take it . __eou__
Hi , I ’ m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . __eou__ I like this one . How much is the rent ? __eou__ $ 850 a month . __eou__ Does the rent include utilities ? __eou__ No . Utilities are extra . __eou__ Where ’ s the laundry room ? __eou__ It ’ s on the other side of this floor . __eou__ What ’ s your rule about pets ? __eou__ We allow one or two pets but you have to pay a $ 300 deposit . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ’ ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ’ ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ’ t allow pet snakes in the apartment . __eou__ who takes care of bug control ? __eou__ We do . We will spray the apartments before you move in . __eou__ Thank you very much for taking your time . I ’ m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . __eou__
This is the house I want to rent . __eou__ Could you tell me the advantages of it ? __eou__ No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . __eou__ There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? __eou__ 200 dollars per week . __eou__ In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . __eou__ It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . __eou__ Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . __eou__ Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? __eou__ I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? __eou__ Twice a week for work and once for shopping . __eou__ In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . __eou__ That's true . Ok , I will think about it . __eou__
Ouch ! I'm hurt . __eou__ Are you all right ? __eou__ Yes . I'm OK . I just had a tumble . No big deal . __eou__ Good . You scared me . __eou__ Sorry . Can you please help me up ! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on . __eou__ Sure . Is this your first time skiing ? __eou__ Yes . I tried skiing on grass before . Not very good at it , though . __eou__
Waiter , I would like to order now . __eou__ Sure . What do you want to have today ? __eou__ Cream soup and steak , please . __eou__ How do you like your steak ? __eou__ Excuse me , what does that mean ? __eou__ Well , there are several kinds of steaks . For example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done . __eou__ Thanks for your explanation , I would like it well-done . __eou__
We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . __eou__ Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out . __eou__ Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . __eou__ That's $ 1 825 . __eou__ We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . __eou__ $ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . __eou__ Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? __eou__ Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . __eou__ Don't mention it , let's go in . __eou__ Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? __eou__ She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? __eou__ A little , I wish I could do that . __eou__ You can !

A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? __eou__ The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . __eou__ It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” __eou__
Hello , may I speak with the property manager , please ? __eou__ Hello , this is the property manager .

Why don't you come out and play with us ? __eou__ That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . __eou__
Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . __eou__ Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? __eou__ Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . __eou__ I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! __eou__ Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . __eou__ Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! __eou__ Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
I'm going to the bank . __eou__ What do you need to do ? __eou__ I need to withdraw some money . __eou__ How are you going to do that ? __eou__ I'll just use the ATM . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's the Automatic Teller Machine . __eou__ It gives you money ? __eou__ I just insert my debit card into the machine . __eou__ And it gives you money ? __eou__ Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money . __eou__ Oh .

Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? __eou__ thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__ that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__ yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__ true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . __eou__ yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th __eou__ yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w __eou__ that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__ I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . __eou__
How is your appetite today ? __eou__ I'm rather hungry now . __eou__ What would you like to have ? __eou__ Please give me a piece of pie first . __eou__ Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? __eou__ Beef , please . __eou__ How about drinks ? Coffee or tea ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ Do you want to take milk and sugar ? __eou__ Only black coffee . __eou__
You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? __eou__ Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . __eou__ So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? __eou__ Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . __eou__ Do you do the same exercises every day ? __eou__ No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . __eou__ Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? __eou__ It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . __eou__ Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . __eou__
Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? __eou__ They're going skiing in Colorado . __eou__ What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! __eou__ You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . __eou__
Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? __eou__ It was okay . __eou__ Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No thanks , I'm not thirsty . __eou__ Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__ Yes I did . __eou__ Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__ Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . __eou__
Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill . __eou__ I cannot , Mum . Nobody can help me ! __eou__ Come on . Let ’ s talk heart to heart . I think we can find a solution . __eou__
Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . __eou__ Of course ! Where are the things ? __eou__ They're all here . __eou__ Right ! I'll do it straight away . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . __eou__
Jenny , you should go to bed now . __eou__ But it's still early . __eou__ Don't stay up late . __eou__ But Day . I'm not sleepy . __eou__ Well , honey . Turn off the light , lie down and go to sleep . __eou__
Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . __eou__ Which brand are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? __eou__ Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? __eou__ It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . __eou__ How about Flymo ? It's selling well . __eou__ Do you have a warranty on it ? __eou__ Of course . The warranty period is one year . __eou__ If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? __eou__ Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . __eou__ OK . I'll take one . __eou__
How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? __eou__ It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? __eou__ I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! __eou__ All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . __eou__ That will be my pleasure . __eou__
Honey , can you set the table ? __eou__ Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? __eou__ Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . __eou__ Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? __eou__ Yeah , go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . __eou__ I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . __eou__ Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? __eou__ They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . __eou__
What in the world is that smell ? __eou__ The aroma of roasting coffee beans . __eou__ Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? __eou__ Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . __eou__ Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? __eou__ This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... __eou__ The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! __eou__
Excuse me , miss . I don't think we need the MP4 any more . We would like to refund it . __eou__ May I see your receipt ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ I am sorry , sir . You bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week . __eou__
Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? __eou__ Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce . ) Here you are . Can I get you anything else ? __eou__ I'm fine for now , thanks . __eou__
Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? __eou__ Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . __eou__ Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? __eou__ You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . __eou__ Are there many things online ? __eou__ Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! __eou__ Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? __eou__ Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . __eou__ Really ? How to do that ? __eou__ Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . __eou__ That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? __eou__ Let's click to check it out . __eou__ Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . __eou__ No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits . __eou__ Are there any disadvantages about it ? __eou__ It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon . __eou__
( Bob groans . ) What's the matter.Bob ? __eou__ I think it's my ankle . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ One of my snowshoes got caught on a rock . __eou__ Can you stand ? __eou__ I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore . __eou__ We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray . __eou__ Is that really necessary ? __eou__ It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ? __eou__ About the same . __eou__ Someone will be out to take a look any minute now . __eou__ Should we be here , Alice ? I don't think it's that serious . __eou__ Of course ! It's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . Will we have to wait much longer ? __eou__ I hope not.It isn't that busy . __eou__
Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . __eou__ Certainly , but will it take long ? __eou__ No , I'll be right back . __eou__ OK . I'll look after it then . __eou__
Do you think you can fix my computer ? __eou__ I'll give it a try . __eou__

Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? __eou__ I've never gotten one . Have you ? __eou__ I got a ticket yesterday . __eou__ Really ?

Here . Keep the change . __eou__ Oh , thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? __eou__ Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Thank you . __eou__
Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ? __eou__ Let me run and check . __eou__
Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . __eou__ oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? __eou__ it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . __eou__ I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . __eou__ oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . __eou__ I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . __eou__ But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . __eou__ well , that's true . __eou__ how about your mother ? __eou__ she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . __eou__ poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . __eou__ Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . __eou__ really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__ not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . __eou__ how do you manage it ? __eou__ it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . __eou__
Did anyone call ? __eou__ Just Mr . White . __eou__ What did he want ? __eou__ He wouldn't say over the phone . __eou__
alright , tell me what you think . __eou__ don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? __eou__ yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? __eou__ that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? __eou__ no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? __eou__ that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__ that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? __eou__ no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . __eou__ that ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__ if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__ it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! __eou__
Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . __eou__ Yes .

How is your house hunting going ? __eou__ Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ How much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! __eou__ How long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . __eou__ Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ No , I thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ I don't think I can afford that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . __eou__
Are you ready to leave ? __eou__ Give me a sec . __eou__
Yes , sir . Where would you like to go ? __eou__ Silk market . __eou__ Is it the one on Xi Shut Street ? __eou__ Yes , That ’ s right . __eou__
Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ? __eou__ The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction . __eou__ Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . __eou__ No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . __eou__ Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ? __eou__ Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! __eou__
How much is this shirt ? __eou__ 80 yuan . __eou__ It's rather expensive , isn't it ? __eou__ It's a bit . But I can give you a discount . __eou__ How about 50 yuan ? __eou__ No . I'm afraid the price is too low . __eou__ Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . __eou__ Dad , it's raining outside . __eou__ That is your excuse . __eou__ All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . __eou__ Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! __eou__
Could you come and help me mend the computer , Neel ? __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ I can't log on the internet again . __eou__ Let me see . Did you change anything on your computer ? __eou__ No , never . __eou__ What kind of anti-virus software do you use ? __eou__ I don't have this kind of software . __eou__ Are you riding ? You have to install an anti-virus software on your computer . If not , you will be attacked by viruses , and it can lead your computer into failure . __eou__

I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . __eou__ You say how high can be exciting ? __eou__ The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . __eou__ I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . __eou__ It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . __eou__ Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . __eou__

If only we could be that thin then ... __eou__ Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that . __eou__ Oh , bathroom blues . __eou__ Look at this girl's gray dress . __eou__ I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small . __eou__ Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade . __eou__ ( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month . __eou__ So why are you dieting this time anyway ? Another guy ? __eou__ Dieting .

How big is this parking lot in our community ? __eou__ It has fifty parking spaces . __eou__ So you guys should be always busy . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I bet it is always full of cars . __eou__ Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . __eou__ Ah ... I see . __eou__ We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . __eou__ What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? __eou__ I am not sure .
