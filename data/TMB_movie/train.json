Anchored by extraordinary performances from a tremendous ensemble cast, Barry Jenkins's staggering, singular vision is profoundly moving in its portrayal of the moments, people and unknowable forces that shape our lives and make us who we are.",
        "I sure can. The synopsis for Moonlight. At once a vital portrait of contemporary African American life and an intensely personal and poetic meditation on identity, family, friendship and love. Moonlight is a groundbreaking piece of cinema that reverberates with deep compassion and universal truths. Anchored by extraordinary performances from a tremendous ensemble cast, Barry Jenkins's staggering, singular vision is profoundly moving in its portrayal of the moments, people and unknowable forces that shape our lives and make us who we are."

Instead, Buddy is an acerbic blowhard who alienates his brother, Stan (David Paymer) and everyone else who fails to bow to his bullying. His agent, Annie Wells (Helen Hunt), has positioned elderly Buddy for a big movie role, but his irreverence might come back to bite him one last time.",
