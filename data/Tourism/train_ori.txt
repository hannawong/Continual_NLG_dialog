A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__ You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? __eou__ I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . __eou__ Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing .
