Hello miss . Can I see your ticket number ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well . __eou__ Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . __eou__ Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . __eou__ The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa .

Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__ Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__ It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__
