How are you ? __eou__ I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do I owe any fees ? __eou__ You sure do . __eou__ Could you tell me how much I owe ? __eou__ You owe $ 235.13 in fees . __eou__ I can ’ t believe that . __eou__ When will you be paying these fees off ? __eou__ I ’ ll pay them off right now . __eou__ Cash or check ? __eou__ I will pay with cash . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , can I cash my traveler's check here ? __eou__ Of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ What's the cashing rate ? __eou__ Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate . __eou__ Oh , I see . How much it the service charge ? __eou__ The service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check . __eou__ Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each . __eou__ Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ OK , there you are . __eou__ And your passport please . __eou__ Oh , I forgot to bring it .

First National Bank . __eou__ Hi , I have a checking account with you . __eou__ How can I help you ? __eou__ I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . __eou__ What's your name and account number ? __eou__
I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . __eou__ Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__ Take your time . __eou__ I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__ Very well , I will . __eou__
Hello , can I speak to Mr.Green ? __eou__ Yes , speaking . __eou__ This is Steven speaking .

Oh , now the asking price is $ 90 each share . By the way , what is the offering price ? __eou__ Let me see . The offering price is near or at $ 88 . __eou__ Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . __eou__ Do you mean that I have to buy it at current price ? __eou__ You can decide by yourself . __eou__ I heard that this stock would go up . Hum , I will take it at current price . __eou__ So , now I will buy you . Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
IBA , how can I help ? __eou__ Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet .

Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... __eou__ I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__ This will fix all of that for you .

To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next week .

We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . __eou__ That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . __eou__ Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__ By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__ Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__ If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__ Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__ All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__ We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . __eou__

I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Good afternoon , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to draw some money from my current account . __eou__ How much do you want to draw ? __eou__ Well , I want to draw out 4,000 yuan . __eou__ OK !

Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping .

Do you have any ideas ? __eou__ Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? __eou__ Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__ Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__ How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__ Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__ Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... __eou__
Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__ I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? __eou__ Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__ Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not .
