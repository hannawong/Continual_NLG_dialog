I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ? __eou__ First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . __eou__ Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? __eou__ No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it . __eou__ What is the annual interest rate ? __eou__ It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . __eou__ By the way , can I open a checking account too ? __eou__ By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . __eou__
What else can I do for you today ? __eou__ Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment .

What it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . It's for doing all types of e-business . __eou__ That does sound interesting .

Credit Services , how can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__ Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? __eou__ Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__ Why such a big difference ? __eou__ It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__ My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__ Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__ That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . __eou__
Welcome . How can we be of service today ? __eou__ Hello . My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500 . She sent it yesterday , using the standard service .

You do have an account with us , right ? __eou__ Yes . Here's my card . Do you need my ID ? __eou__ Please . Just to double check all the details . __eou__ There you go . __eou__
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ What about the outer packing ? __eou__ We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Cartons ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__ If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__ We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . __eou__ Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . __eou__ I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . __eou__ You mean , if there is any left over ? __eou__ Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__ Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__ That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . __eou__

Thanks . __eou__

We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? __eou__ I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... __eou__ Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . __eou__ That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . __eou__ Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . __eou__
That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__ Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__ I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__ Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__ What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__ If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__

No , I wasn't aware of that . __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
Hey honey , how was your day ? __eou__ It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__ Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ Not in a million years ! __eou__
Okay , I want to change 22,000 . __eou__ Could you please fill out this form ? __eou__ Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . ) __eou__ Here's your $ 200 . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
