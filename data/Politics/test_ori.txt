911 emergency . What is the problem ? __eou__ I would like to report a break-in . __eou__ When was this break-in ? __eou__ I believe it happened last night . __eou__ Where was the break-in ? __eou__ It happened at my house . __eou__ Was anything stolen ? __eou__ I haven't checked yet . __eou__ Why do you think there was a break-in ? __eou__ My front window was broken . __eou__ We'll send a squad car shortly . __eou__ I'd appreciate that . __eou__
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Look ! This window is open . __eou__ Did you open it before we left ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__ I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__ No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__ It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ I locked it when I left though . __eou__ Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__ I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__ Look around . __eou__ The TV's still here . __eou__ And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__ But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? __eou__
This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! __eou__ Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? __eou__ It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . __eou__ I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . __eou__ That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! __eou__ Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__
Are you voting tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course . What about you ? __eou__ You know that I am . __eou__ Where is your polling place ? __eou__ It ’ s at the park up the street . __eou__ Oh , is that right ? __eou__ Where ’ s your polling place ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ How come you don ’ t know where it is ? __eou__ Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place . __eou__ You should check online . __eou__ Oh , really ?

I know things are going to be better . __eou__
There's someone coming . __eou__ It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__ Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__ I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__ I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__ I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__ Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . __eou__
