Did you hear anything about the robbery ? __eou__ I watched it happen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . I was right there . __eou__ What did you see ? __eou__ This guy tried to rob the bank . __eou__ I can't believe it . __eou__ I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__ What happened next ? __eou__ He tried to leave with the money . __eou__ Did he get caught ? __eou__ They caught him before he could walk through the front door . __eou__
Can you tell me what happened here ? __eou__ Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . __eou__ Did you see the car before it hit you ? __eou__ No , I didn't . That car was too fast . __eou__ Which lane were you in ? __eou__ I don't remember . __eou__ What was your speed then ? __eou__ 40 miles per hour . __eou__ Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ? __eou__ Just straight . __eou__ OK , please move your vehicle off to the side of the road . We will check on it . Do you feel like you need an ambulance , Miss ? __eou__ No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . __eou__ No problem , Miss . __eou__
You voted , right ? __eou__ You know I did . __eou__ Who did you vote for ? __eou__ I voted for Obama , of course ! __eou__ Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__ I knew he would win . __eou__ I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__ He was the top candidate . __eou__ I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__ That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . __eou__
What is your case against the police ? __eou__ They arrested me for nothing . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . __eou__ Didn ’ t they let you go ? __eou__ They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . __eou__ So they kept you at the station ? __eou__ They sure did . __eou__ Did they tell you why they arrested you ? __eou__ I matched the description of a robbery suspect . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ I want to take them to court . __eou__
Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? __eou__ I ’ m so happy about that . __eou__ Did you vote for him ? __eou__ I sure did . How about you ? __eou__ I voted for him . __eou__ I have complete confidence in our new President . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I know he will help change America . __eou__ I hope so , because America needs a change . __eou__ I feel like things are already changing , because he was elected . __eou__ I agree with you completely . __eou__ I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands . __eou__
Order ! __eou__ Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea . __eou__ What ’ s your plea ? __eou__ I am pleading not guilty . __eou__ But all the evidence points to you . __eou__ I am not the guilty party __eou__ What are you saying ? __eou__ I am not the person who committed that crime . __eou__ Who is ? __eou__ Will you let me go if I tell you ? __eou__ We can work something out . __eou__ I have no problem singing like a canary . __eou__
Have you heard who got elected ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ Our new President is John McCain . __eou__ What ? You can ’ t be serious ! __eou__ I was just as shocked when I found out . __eou__ Why would anyone vote for McCain ? __eou__ The people have spoken . __eou__ That ’ s horrible . __eou__ If you don ’ t like that , then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what I tell you next . __eou__ More bad news ? __eou__ I was just joking , and Obama is our new President . __eou__ Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news . __eou__
I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__ What would you like to speak to me about ? __eou__ I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . __eou__ I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . __eou__ Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ I ’ m going to vote . __eou__ Go to your polling place early on Election Day . __eou__ I will . Good luck with your volunteering . __eou__
They don't really think you took it , do they ? __eou__ I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life . __eou__ How many of them were there ? __eou__ Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . __eou__ What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? __eou__ I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . __eou__ Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . __eou__ Hmm . Thank you very much . __eou__
Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__ But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__ Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . __eou__
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . __eou__ I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__ And it takes up all the news . __eou__ The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__ It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . __eou__ Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . __eou__ I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . __eou__ Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I have to go to work . __eou__ Going to work where ? __eou__ I ’ m working at the polling place . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you were working there this year . __eou__ I work at the polling place every year . __eou__ How did you get that job ? __eou__ I signed up for it online . __eou__ That ’ s really cool . __eou__ It ’ s a very cool job . __eou__ Do they pay you a lot ? __eou__ They pay well enough . __eou__
911 . How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to report a break-in . __eou__ When did this break-in occur ? __eou__ Last night . __eou__ Where did the break-in happen ? __eou__ It happened at my house . __eou__ Was anything taken ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ What makes you think there was a break-in ? __eou__ My front window was busted . __eou__ I'll send a squad car . __eou__ Please hurry . __eou__
Were you around when the robbery happened ? __eou__ Yes , I was . __eou__ Could you explain what you saw ? __eou__ I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . __eou__ What did you see ? __eou__ I saw a man come in with a gun . __eou__ Did you see his face ? __eou__ No . He had a mask on . __eou__ Did he come in with anyone else ? __eou__ He was by himself . __eou__ Would you come down to the station for further questioning ? __eou__ That shouldn't be a problem . __eou__
What are you here for today ? __eou__ I need to fight this ticket that I got . __eou__ Is the arresting officer here ? __eou__ Yes , he is , Your Honor . __eou__ Plead your case . __eou__ I was told by the officer that I ran a red light . That information isn't true . __eou__ Why would the officer lie ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but the signal had a camera on it . __eou__ Did the camera take a picture of your license plate ? __eou__ No , my picture wasn't taken . __eou__ There was no picture taken , so I'll let you go . __eou__ Thank you very much , Your Honor . __eou__

Do you believe in god ? __eou__ Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? __eou__ I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__ I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . __eou__
You say he was around average hight . __eou__ Yeah , that's right , around five nine five ten . __eou__ Weight ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side . __eou__ Any karks on his face ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Glasses ? __eou__ No . __eou__ what about his hair ? __eou__ Black or dark brown . __eou__ Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__ Straight , I think , and about average length . __eou__ Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ?

You know the kind of number jack wear . __eou__ Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ? __eou__ Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . __eou__ What kind of shoes ? __eou__ Boots __eou__ Cow while Boots . __eou__ No , hiking boots . Brown ones . __eou__ All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures . __eou__
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? __eou__ We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . __eou__
Will you tell me the situation ? __eou__ I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . __eou__ I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . __eou__ I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . __eou__
Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ I will be voting tomorrow . __eou__ What ’ s your polling place ? __eou__ My polling place is at the park up the street . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? __eou__ Yeah , where is yours ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__ How is it you don ’ t know ? __eou__ The location of my polling place never came in the mail . __eou__ You can always just check online . __eou__ Let me go do that . __eou__
Are you okay ? __eou__ No . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ I got robbed ! __eou__ By who ? __eou__ Some guy on the street just mugged me . __eou__ Are you hurt ? __eou__ No , he just stole all of my things . __eou__ That's crazy . __eou__ I need to go to the police station . __eou__ Do you want me to take you ? __eou__ That would be great .

Order in the court ! __eou__ I would like to make my plea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I would like to plead not guilty . __eou__ You do realize that all the evidence points to you ? __eou__ I know . But I did not do it . __eou__ How do you figure that ? __eou__ I didn ’ t commit the crime . __eou__ Do you know who did ? __eou__ If I tell you who did , will you release me ? __eou__ I ’ m sure we can work out some kind of deal . __eou__ I ’ ll tell you all you need to know . __eou__

What ’ s the matter , dear ? __eou__ Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . __eou__ Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? __eou__ No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . __eou__ You must tell the embassy about it .

Are you going somewhere ? __eou__ I ’ m on my way to work . __eou__ Where do you work ? __eou__ I work at the polling place . __eou__ You didn ’ t tell me you were working there this year . __eou__ I do this every year . __eou__ How ’ d you get that job ? __eou__ I applied online . __eou__ That ’ s interesting . __eou__ I enjoy working there every year . __eou__ How much do they pay ? __eou__ They pay just enough . __eou__

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Why are you arresting me ? __eou__ There is a warrant out for your arrest . __eou__ What kind of warrant ? __eou__ You have a bench warrant . __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ Have you missed a court date ? __eou__ I never went to court . __eou__ I can't help you . __eou__ This is unfair . __eou__ A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . __eou__ I have rights , don't I ? __eou__ You have the right to an attorney . __eou__
Would you like to make a donation ? __eou__ Donations for what ? __eou__ It ’ s for the campaigns . __eou__ How much money are you trying to raise ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter how much . __eou__ What are you doing to raise money ? __eou__ We go door to door asking for donations . __eou__ You should try other fundraisers . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ You can always wash cars and sell candy . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . __eou__ That ’ ll help you make more money . __eou__
Were you at the scene during the robbery ? __eou__ Yes , I was , Officer . __eou__ Were you able to see a lot ? __eou__ I was there as it happened . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ The robber came in with a gun . __eou__ Could you see his face ? __eou__ He had a mask over his face . __eou__ Was he with someone else ? __eou__ He was alone . __eou__ Would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ? __eou__ I would be happy to . __eou__
Were you able to get a look at the suspect's face ? __eou__ Yes . I know exactly what he looks like . __eou__ I must ask you to pick him out of a line-up . __eou__ That won't be a problem . __eou__ Look closely at the five men in this line-up . __eou__ I am looking . __eou__ Do you see the suspect ? __eou__ Yes . He's in the line-up . __eou__ What number is the suspect ? __eou__ Number four . __eou__ Thank you for all your help . __eou__ It was no problem at all . __eou__
Did you vote ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__ Who was your vote for President ? __eou__ My vote was for Barack Obama . __eou__ I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__ I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__ What made you think that ? __eou__ Nobody could compete with him . __eou__ I thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__ Times are changing . __eou__ That ’ s true . __eou__ I support our new President 100 % . __eou__
Are you going to vote ? __eou__ I am . Are you ? __eou__ Yes , and for the first time . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I don ’ t know how to vote . __eou__ Voting isn ’ t difficult . __eou__ I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . __eou__ They tell you everything on the ballot . __eou__ They do ? __eou__ You ’ ll be okay . __eou__ Thanks for telling me . __eou__ You should be excited about your first vote . __eou__

If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you.Do you understand ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What's your name ? __eou__ My name is James . __eou__ What's your nationality ? __eou__ American . __eou__ What's your relationship with the victim ? __eou__ I don't know him . __eou__ Why did you attack the victim ? __eou__ Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . __eou__ How many times did you stab the victim ? __eou__ I stabbed his belly three times . __eou__ Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? __eou__ I knew , but I couldn't myself . __eou__ Was it your intention to kill the victim ? __eou__ No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney . __eou__ OK.Give me his number and we'll contact him . __eou__
It ’ s nice meeting you . __eou__ It ’ s nice to meet you , too . __eou__ I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate . __eou__ Would you like to ask me anything ? __eou__ What do you feel about gay marriage ? __eou__ I think everyone has the right to love who they want . __eou__ Would you legalize gay marriage ? __eou__ Yes , I would . __eou__ Many people won ’ t like that . __eou__ I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage . __eou__ I really like you . __eou__ I really appreciate that . __eou__
I am really excited ! __eou__ Why are you so excited ? __eou__ I just got done voting . __eou__ This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ I just turned 18 last month . __eou__ That is so lucky of you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__ I didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . __eou__ Congratulations on being a part of history . __eou__
How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__ Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__ Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist __eou__ What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__ This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__ They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle __eou__
Are you going to vote ? __eou__ I am so excited to be voting . __eou__ Do you know who you ’ re going to vote for ? __eou__ I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . __eou__ What ’ s so great about him ? __eou__ I feel that he is very intelligent . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Yes , and I agree with all his policies . __eou__ That ’ s good to hear . __eou__ I think this man is going to be the next President . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ I ’ m going to make sure and get my vote in . __eou__

Didn ’ t you ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__ I have total faith in Obama as our President . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Our country really could use some work . __eou__ I believe that change has already begun . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . __eou__ I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country . __eou__

But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . __eou__ The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . __eou__ You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness __eou__ Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . __eou__ That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . __eou__

Are you going to vote ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ Yeah , but what day are the elections ? __eou__ You don ’ t know what day the elections are ? __eou__ That ’ s why I ’ m asking you . __eou__ They ’ re this coming Tuesday . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m serious . __eou__ Good thing you told me . __eou__ I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were . __eou__ It slipped my mind . __eou__ You should watch the news more often . __eou__
How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__
Are you here about your ticket ? __eou__ Yes , I am , Your Honor . __eou__ What is your argument ? __eou__ Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding . __eou__ You must've been speeding . __eou__ No , Your Honor , I was not . __eou__ Tell me how many miles per hour you were going . __eou__ I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone . __eou__ That's fine , so I'll let you go with a warning . __eou__ So , I don't have to pay the ticket ? __eou__ You won't have to pay the fine . __eou__ Thank you very much , Your Honor . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__

One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . __eou__ Did you get a good look at them ? __eou__ I'm afraid not .

The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__ I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__ He is so unskillful .

Do you have any idea why I pulled you over today ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ One of your brake lights is out . __eou__ Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that . __eou__ I'm going to give you a ticket . __eou__ Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? __eou__ It's just a ticket . __eou__ How much is the fine ? __eou__ The judge will let you know . __eou__ I have to be at court ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ All right . Just give me the ticket . __eou__

This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ happening ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! __eou__ Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? __eou__ It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . __eou__ I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . __eou__ That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! __eou__ Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__

He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__

Do I still need to pay ? __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__ I'm so glad for your help . __eou__

My friend did . __eou__ Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__ Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__ I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__ Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__ Should I call the police ? __eou__ You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__ Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__ I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__

People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . __eou__ I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__ Yeah , you are right ! __eou__
