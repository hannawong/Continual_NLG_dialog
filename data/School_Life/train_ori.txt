I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ Do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ I don't know .

Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . __eou__ Exactly . He is unbelievable . __eou__ On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . __eou__ They were really tough . __eou__ The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . __eou__ I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . __eou__
Did you ever take History 231 ? __eou__ Yeah . Last semester . __eou__ Who was the professor ? __eou__ It was Professor Johnson . __eou__ I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? __eou__ He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . __eou__ What did you end up getting ? __eou__ I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . __eou__ That's probably because he grades on a curve . __eou__ Are you enjoying the class so far ? __eou__ I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . __eou__ Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores .

People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? __eou__ In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . __eou__ It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? __eou__ You'll get used to it gradually . __eou__ Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? __eou__ Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . __eou__ Three months ? Incredible ! __eou__
What do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ He's very strict with us . __eou__ And I hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
We have a class outing today . __eou__ Have fun . __eou__

I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . __eou__

That ’ s a vast country . __eou__ Canada , china , and the use are huge too . __eou__ There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__
What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? __eou__ I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? __eou__ I don't know .

My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . __eou__ I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . __eou__ Why were you in Japan ? __eou__ My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . __eou__ That's pretty cool . __eou__ I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . __eou__ Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . __eou__ Thanks for the offer .

I have to do well . __eou__ But what you should do is study hard . __eou__ I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught . __eou__ So long as you learn from your mistakes . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__

Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park days and evenings . __eou__ Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? __eou__ What signs ? __eou__ As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? __eou__ What curb colors ? __eou__ If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . __eou__
I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . __eou__ You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . __eou__ I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . __eou__ You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . __eou__

I ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like . __eou__ That ’ s just what I need . Thanks so much . You ’ Ve been a big help already . __eou__

What will you do ? __eou__ They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese . __eou__ That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do . __eou__ It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up . __eou__ Good . I'll do it . __eou__
Can I ask you a question ? __eou__ Sure , go ahead . __eou__ How do you get along with the American students in your classes ? __eou__ I don ’ t have much contact with them . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I ’ m too afraid of making mistakes in English . I don ’ t want to be laughed at . __eou__ You won ’ t get anywhere that way . You ’ re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing .

Did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__ Thanks . See ya . __eou__

Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right !

That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . __eou__ Me ! Me ! __eou__ Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__ Well , OK . But no French kissing ! __eou__ As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again .

I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then .

How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . __eou__

Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! __eou__

You can keep these books for only half a month . __eou__ May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? __eou__ Of course , you can . __eou__
What do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ Study English . __eou__ You mean you like to study English ?

May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me . __eou__
Hi , Ann . __eou__ Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? __eou__ I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . __eou__ And you're planning to enter ? __eou__ Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . __eou__ Is there a prize ? __eou__ I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . __eou__ Do you think you have a chance ? __eou__ A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . __eou__ But you haven't practised all that much . __eou__ I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! __eou__ Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . __eou__
Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ? __eou__ It was great . I had a really good time . __eou__ What classes did you have ? __eou__ Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock . __eou__ What do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring ! __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? __eou__ She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . __eou__ Where is she from ? __eou__ She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America . __eou__ Were you able to understand everything that she said ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ? __eou__ Yes ... with flying colors ! __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! __eou__ If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ did she give you any homework ? __eou__ not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , __eou__ no wonder you like the class so much . __eou__
Did you get your grades yet ? __eou__ Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__ Ouch . You must be very disappointed . __eou__ Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . __eou__ Why don't you re-take the class next year ? __eou__ That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? __eou__ I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . __eou__ My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . __eou__ What was your GPA before this semester ? __eou__ I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . __eou__ Why did it go down so much ? __eou__ Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . __eou__ What happened to you ? __eou__ I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . __eou__ You better stop slacking off . __eou__ You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . __eou__
I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? __eou__ There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T __eou__ I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . __eou__ Which tests do you mean ? __eou__ You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? __eou__ Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . __eou__ Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . __eou__ You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . __eou__
Who's that over here ? __eou__ That's the new teacher . __eou__ What do you think of the teacher ? __eou__ She's very nice . __eou__ What does she teach ? __eou__ English , of course . __eou__ Is she your teacher ? __eou__ Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . __eou__ Can she speak Chinese to her students ? __eou__ Not very much . __eou__ It's a good thing you can speak English ! __eou__
How's your thesis going ? __eou__ Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . __eou__ I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . __eou__ Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . __eou__
Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said . __eou__ I asked you if you wanted some help . __eou__ I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ? __eou__ Certainly .

If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title ' __eou__ Great , thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . __eou__ Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . __eou__ I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? __eou__ It might be the English teacher . What about you ? __eou__ Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . __eou__ Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . __eou__ I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . __eou__ Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . __eou__
Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__

It has to be smooth to go in . __eou__ It won't go in ! __eou__ Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . __eou__ Yes , next step . __eou__ Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . __eou__ They're totally unreliable . __eou__ You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! __eou__

Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US .

I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__ We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__ I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__ That ’ s an excellent idea .

I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . __eou__ Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? __eou__ I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . __eou__ These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? __eou__ That would be great ! __eou__ Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? __eou__ This one right here should be right . __eou__ Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do the math . __eou__ I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total .

I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . __eou__ Have you tried university part-time jobs ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . __eou__ Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? __eou__ Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . __eou__ I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . __eou__ Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . __eou__ But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . __eou__ I already had that idea . __eou__ Well , why don't you go and look down there ? __eou__ But I don't know what I would do . __eou__ It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . __eou__ Maybe . I don't know . __eou__ I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . __eou__ I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . __eou__

Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . __eou__ So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . __eou__ No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ What if I don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ Well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ Could you give me an example ? __eou__ Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . __eou__

I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ But it ’ s so old . __eou__ Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ No , not at all . __eou__ First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ Why does he want to do that ? __eou__ Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ It would take a lot less time .. __eou__ How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ Ok . That sounds like a deal . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__

How about you ? __eou__ after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide __eou__ we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . __eou__ if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . __eou__ unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . __eou__ that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . __eou__ as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . __eou__ my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . __eou__ I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . __eou__
You did well on the math test . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ? __eou__ Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . __eou__ Huh ?

What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . __eou__ Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? __eou__ No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . __eou__ Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . __eou__ Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? __eou__ Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__ So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ?

Especially with girls . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . __eou__ Oh , certainly .

You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . __eou__ Alright . See you later . __eou__

Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? __eou__ Three would be a good time . __eou__ Great , do you need directions to my office ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . __eou__ OK , I'll find it . __eou__ It's very easy to find . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! __eou__
Bonjour ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said , Bonjour ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ? __eou__ I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong with speaking English ? __eou__ Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! __eou__ What are you doing that for ? __eou__ I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__
Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today . __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative . __eou__ Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ? __eou__ Yes , I've got that part covered . __eou__ When , exactly do you need to leave ? __eou__ I don't need to leave until the very end of class . __eou__ Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . __eou__ Thanks , Professor . See you later ! __eou__ See you later ! Drive carefully . __eou__
Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you . __eou__
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . __eou__ Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? __eou__ I want to buy a drink . __eou__ OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . __eou__ I've got the correct change already . __eou__ First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . __eou__ OK , what next ? __eou__ Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . __eou__ OK , next ? __eou__ Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__ Hope that works for you ! __eou__
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . __eou__ Grades are based on many things __eou__ What counts the most ? __eou__ Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . __eou__ Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? __eou__ Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . __eou__ What if we miss something ? __eou__ I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . __eou__ Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? __eou__ You will be able to track your progress during the year . __eou__
Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done . __eou__ What happened that you didn't get it done ? __eou__ I had to watch a football game instead . __eou__ Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? __eou__ I'll make it up next week . __eou__ Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class . __eou__ OK , I can do that . __eou__ Remember that you are in college now , not high school . __eou__
Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . __eou__ She must be very sad . __eou__ Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . __eou__ At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university.That ' ll be in September.But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Li . __eou__ Morning , Mike . __eou__ I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday . __eou__ I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ? __eou__ I feel much better now . __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? __eou__ I've already got it . Thanks . __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class , could you preview it ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . __eou__ Yeah , sometimes . __eou__
Adam , could you show me around the school ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ What's the tallest building ? __eou__ You mean the white building near the playground ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books . __eou__ What's the building to the south of the library ? __eou__ You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . __eou__ Is there a swimming pool in your school ? __eou__ Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . __eou__ I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . __eou__ I believe that you can make your dream come true . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
did you go to university ? __eou__ yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . __eou__ when did you graduate ? __eou__ just a few years ago . What about you ? __eou__ I just graduated from high school . __eou__ are you planning on going to university ? __eou__ I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . __eou__ have you applied anywhere yet ? __eou__ yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . __eou__ congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? __eou__ the tuition is the same for all of them . __eou__ which one has the most interesting course ? __eou__ I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . __eou__ where would you like to be located ? __eou__ I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . __eou__ have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? __eou__ not yet . __eou__ I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
What's your schedule like this year ? __eou__ Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . __eou__ What's your major ? __eou__ I ’ m majoring in French literature . __eou__ Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long . __eou__ That's right . We got the assignment last week . __eou__ When is it due ? __eou__ Next Monday . __eou__ Remind me never to sign up for that course . __eou__
How are you getting along with your paper ? __eou__ I haven't finished it . It is very difficult . __eou__ You should hand it in before next Sunday . __eou__ Oh , I know . I will try my best . __eou__ I believe you can do a good job . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to find this book . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you guys have it . __eou__ You should look it up on our computer . __eou__ I did that . __eou__ What came up ? __eou__ It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . __eou__ I can try to get the book from a different library . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you could do that . __eou__ I will call you when I find it . __eou__ I appreciate your help . __eou__
Emily , what kind of report is this ? __eou__ What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . __eou__ Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . __eou__
Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . __eou__ You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . __eou__ No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . __eou__ One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . __eou__ How could he make such a silly mistake ? __eou__ He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ Why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ Isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ You must have a high IQ score . __eou__ Well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ My IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ Seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ Let's go ! __eou__
The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... __eou__ Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . __eou__ Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . __eou__ but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . __eou__ I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . __eou__ it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . __eou__ you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . __eou__ it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . __eou__ yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . __eou__ that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? __eou__ well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . __eou__ sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . __eou__
you look better today . How did your test go ? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday . __eou__ did you pass ? __eou__ I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! __eou__ you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . __eou__ thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . __eou__ you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . __eou__ did you always do well at school ? __eou__ no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . __eou__ really ? __eou__ sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months . __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams ? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead . __eou__ do you think that's a good idea ? __eou__ no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it . __eou__ I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends . __eou__ Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ? __eou__ I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ? __eou__ I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own . __eou__ Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job ! __eou__ Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return . __eou__ Yeah , I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money . __eou__
I am not sure how to add a class . __eou__ Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? __eou__ I'll bring one next time . __eou__ When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . __eou__ Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? __eou__ Thank you for your directions . It's clear . __eou__ You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . __eou__ That's great . Thank you so much . __eou__ Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! __eou__
Okay , let's begin . Hello , everyone . My name's Karl Roberts , and I'll be your teacher for this class , Intercultural Communication . __eou__ ( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying . __eou__ Uh , to begin with , please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 . __eou__ That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning ? __eou__ Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation . __eou__ I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not . __eou__
Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? __eou__ Yes , just once . __eou__ What was the reason ? __eou__ I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . __eou__

This library is too quiet though . __eou__ Do you want to go to and empty classroom ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Ok . Let ’ s go ! __eou__
Excuse me , I need your assistance . __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I have no idea where my class is . __eou__ Tell me which building it's in . __eou__ My class is in the C building . __eou__ I know where the C building is . __eou__ Do you mind telling me where it is ? __eou__ Of course , which room number is it ? __eou__ Number 261 . __eou__ I actually have a class right around there . __eou__ Can you please show me ? __eou__ I can do that . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ What time will the library be closing ? __eou__ It closes at six . __eou__ Does it always close at six ? __eou__ No , not every day . __eou__ Will the library be open on Saturday ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ What are your hours on Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . __eou__ All right . Thank you . __eou__ What else can I help you with ? __eou__ That ’ s it . Thank you . __eou__

It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . __eou__ You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__ Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? __eou__ I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . __eou__ Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__ That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__ I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__ And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__ Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby .

I'll see you then . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ Looking forward to meeting with you ! __eou__
I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__
Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . __eou__ Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? __eou__ There's a problem with my schedule . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Two of my classes occur at the same time . __eou__ Well , I can see that's a problem . __eou__ Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? __eou__ Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? __eou__ I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . __eou__ Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . __eou__ Is this absolutely necessary ? __eou__ I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . __eou__ Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? __eou__ I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . __eou__ Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . __eou__ Yes , I remember . __eou__ Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . __eou__ Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! __eou__
Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? __eou__ Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning . __eou__ Got any plans after the class ? __eou__ Not really . What about you ? __eou__ We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? __eou__ Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . __eou__ Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? __eou__ Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . __eou__ Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! __eou__ See you then . __eou__
Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . __eou__ I guess you'll have to wing it . __eou__
so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ? __eou__ i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work . __eou__ what are you specializing in ? __eou__ right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes . __eou__ that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ? __eou__ yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little . __eou__ really ? How did you do that ? __eou__ well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . __eou__ that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? __eou__ I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . __eou__ when did you take your exams ? __eou__ about two weeks ago . __eou__ how do you think you did ? __eou__ I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? __eou__ You know me ; I'm always studying ! __eou__ don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! __eou__ Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! __eou__
I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . __eou__ Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes . __eou__
Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . __eou__ What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? __eou__ Both . __eou__ I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm ready . __eou__ Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . __eou__ These look strange . __eou__ Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? __eou__ OK , let's do the calculation . __eou__ We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask ! __eou__
what do you think of studying abroad ? __eou__ I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? __eou__ yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now . __eou__ which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive . __eou__ have you applied to any schools there ? __eou__ yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago . __eou__ congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? __eou__ I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ? __eou__ if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ? __eou__ I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University . __eou__ if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . __eou__ I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make . __eou__ if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . __eou__
This is my admission card , and these are the books . __eou__ OK , a moment , please . __eou__ By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? __eou__ For which one ? __eou__ Sense and Sensibility , English version . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Can I just do it here ? __eou__ Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . __eou__ OK , thanks . __eou__ Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . __eou__ I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? __eou__ 3 Yuan , please . __eou__ Here you are . Thanks . __eou__ You are welcome . See you next time . __eou__
Hi ! Ed , what's up ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Doesn't look like it to me . __eou__ Just get out of my face ! __eou__ Woo , easy . __eou__ Leave me alone ! __eou__ What are you so ticked off about ? __eou__ I don't want to talk about it . __eou__ Maybe I can help . __eou__ I blew the finally exam . __eou__ You've got to be joking . __eou__ No , I'm not . __eou__ Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to get on the Internet . __eou__ Do you have your library card with you ? __eou__ Yes , I have it . __eou__ You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . __eou__ That ’ s okay . __eou__ Please put your name on this list . __eou__ Then what do I need to do ? __eou__ When there is a computer available , I will call you . __eou__ What do I do to log on to the computer ? __eou__ Just type in the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Okay . Thanks for your help . __eou__
David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__
How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate all your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . __eou__
Good morning . I want to apply for a library card . __eou__ Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please . __eou__ But I hear that the card is free . __eou__ Yes , it is . But you must pay a deposit for the card . __eou__ There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? __eou__ Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__
Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . __eou__ Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . __eou__ Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . __eou__ Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? __eou__ What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . __eou__ I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! __eou__ I know , but I listened . __eou__ Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . __eou__ I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . __eou__ There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . __eou__ That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__ Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__ Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? __eou__ I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . __eou__ He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? __eou__ I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . __eou__ Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? __eou__ I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__ He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__ Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__ I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! __eou__
Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ? __eou__ Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . __eou__ Really ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ How do you feel about that ? __eou__ Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . __eou__ Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? __eou__ Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . __eou__ What especially about the night life are you going to miss ? __eou__ Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . __eou__ How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? __eou__ Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . __eou__
Do you need help with something ? __eou__ I ’ m looking for this book . __eou__ Is there something wrong ? __eou__ I don ’ t see it on the shelf . __eou__ Did you check the computer ? __eou__ I already looked . __eou__ Did it say anything ? __eou__ It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m sure I can get it from another library . __eou__ Could you do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll let you know when I get the book in . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thank you so much . __eou__

are you looking for a course ? __eou__ yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . __eou__ what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . __eou__ what kind of course are you looking for ? __eou__ I need to improve my English . __eou__ do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? __eou__ I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . __eou__ have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? __eou__ I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . __eou__ that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure . Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings . __eou__ thanks . I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course . __eou__
Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president . __eou__ Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? __eou__ We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . __eou__ And you think I fit the qualifications ? __eou__ Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . __eou__ Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . __eou__
Do you know where I can park ? __eou__ Do you need a spot here or off campus ? __eou__ I want a space on campus . __eou__ There's a parking structure for students . __eou__ Where can I find it ? __eou__ Go to the western side of the campus , and you'll find it there . __eou__ Is it full ? __eou__ When I went up there , it wasn't full at all . __eou__ When was that ? __eou__ Sometime this morning . __eou__ Would it be full now ? __eou__ I am really not sure . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I want to check these books out . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ That ’ s all . __eou__ May I see your library card , please ? __eou__ It ’ s right here . __eou__ Will that be all for today ? __eou__ Yes . That ’ s it . __eou__ These are due back in two weeks . __eou__ All right . Have a good night . __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . __eou__ Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . __eou__ You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . __eou__ Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . __eou__ You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . __eou__ Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . __eou__
You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes . __eou__ All right . But how ? __eou__ Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . __eou__ I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? __eou__ OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . __eou__ Thank you so much , Mr Addison . __eou__
Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
I am unsure how to add a class and need help . __eou__ I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? __eou__ Yes , I have an add sheet . __eou__ After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . __eou__ When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . __eou__ Thanks . I understand what to do now . __eou__ It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! __eou__
Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Are you in his class ? __eou__ I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . __eou__ He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? __eou__ Yes , I really need someone who is really good . __eou__ I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? __eou__ Maybe , but I'm not sure . __eou__ Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? __eou__ No , that stuff isn't important to me . __eou__ Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? __eou__ I don't care about any of that . __eou__ We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . __eou__
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__ Well done ! __eou__
I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__
I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class . __eou__ Where do you need to be that is more important than school ? __eou__ I have an appointment . __eou__ Do you have a plan to make up your missed work ? __eou__ No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . __eou__ Are you going to go right away ? __eou__ I am leaving right now . __eou__ All right , but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up . __eou__ Thanks , Professor . I'll make sure everything gets taken care of . __eou__ Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school . __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? __eou__ Harry Potter . __eou__ Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? __eou__ Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ Have you ever read this book before ? __eou__ No , but my little brother likes it very much . __eou__ It's really a good book . You will like it too . __eou__ I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . __eou__ Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? __eou__ Jane Austen . __eou__ Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . __eou__ I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . __eou__
Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . __eou__ Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? __eou__ For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! __eou__ Have you treated any real emergencies ? __eou__ Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! __eou__ I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! __eou__
Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . __eou__ Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . __eou__ Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . __eou__ Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . __eou__ That's a problem . __eou__
Are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . __eou__
