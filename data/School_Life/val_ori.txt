Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? __eou__ Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy that candy . __eou__ OK .

I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit .

Why are you so late ? __eou__ I've been through a lot today . I forgot to set my alarm clock last night , so I woke up late this morning . And what is worse , I missed the school bus . __eou__ That's enough . Sit down . __eou__

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester !

It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__
