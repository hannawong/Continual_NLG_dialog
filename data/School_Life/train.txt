David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ?

How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __sou__ That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .

Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __sou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .

Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system .

Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __sou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
