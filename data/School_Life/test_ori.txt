Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . __eou__ Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I like it so far . But my English still needs work . __eou__ I want to study Mandarin and international relations . __eou__ Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? __eou__ They teach regular characters . __eou__ I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . __eou__ You just said your English needs work , yes ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . __eou__ Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . __eou__ You mean you and I ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? __eou__ Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . __eou__ How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? __eou__ First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . __eou__ Would I help you with writing ? __eou__ No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . __eou__ I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? __eou__ Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 __eou__ Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 __eou__ So if you want to meet at 10 __eou__ It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . __eou__ And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . __eou__ Let me give you my phone number . __eou__ Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . __eou__
Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? __eou__ Yes , they are all on the shelf . __eou__ Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes . Here you are . __eou__
How did you do in the last quiz ? __eou__ I doubt if I can pass it . __eou__ Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . __eou__ But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . __eou__ I hope you'll do better in the final . __eou__ I must , if I want to pass the course . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I want to get a passport . __eou__ You need to apply for a passport . __eou__ When can I apply for it ? __eou__ You can apply right now . __eou__ I ’ d like to do that . __eou__ Fill this out , please . __eou__ What ’ s next ? __eou__ I will need to take your passport picture . __eou__ When will my passport be ready ? __eou__ It will take about three weeks . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thank you . __eou__
how did you do on your BELTS exam ? __eou__ fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . __eou__ that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__ yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . __eou__ do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ no . __eou__ it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . __eou__ that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ? __eou__ have you ever gone abroad before ? __eou__ yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan . __eou__ have you ever been denied a visa before ? __eou__ never . __eou__ that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ? __eou__ no , I want to come back to China after I graduate . __eou__ that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? __eou__ I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . __eou__ I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . __eou__ that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . __eou__
Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ You are quite good at English , can you help me with it . __eou__ That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools . __eou__ English school ? What is that ? __eou__ This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English . __eou__ Is that different from our school's English course ? __eou__ Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . __eou__
What may I do for you ? __eou__ I need to get a passport . __eou__ You will need to apply for one . __eou__ When will I be able to do that ? __eou__ You can do it right now , if you ’ d like . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Please fill out this application . __eou__ Then what do I do ? __eou__ I just need to take your picture . __eou__ How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? __eou__ You will get it in a few weeks . __eou__ That ’ s perfect . __eou__
Have you been in America long , Hellen ? __eou__ No . Only for a couple of weeks . __eou__ Where are you going to study ? __eou__ I am going to register at Harvard next month . __eou__ What are you going to major in ? __eou__ I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ? __eou__ For nearly four years . __eou__ Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay . At the moment , I am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school . __eou__
How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . __eou__ Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Here you are . You must return them within a month . __eou__ What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? __eou__ You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . __eou__ OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . __eou__ No trouble at all . So long . __eou__
Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . __eou__ Do we have to type out our homework ? __eou__ Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one . __eou__ We are allowed to use a calculator in class ? __eou__ Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . __eou__
Tom , you're my good friend , right ? __eou__ Sure . What's the matter with you ? __eou__ The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ? __eou__ Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . __eou__ What's your favorite course , Daniel ? __eou__ I like science most . __eou__ Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__ Surprise ? __eou__ I thought you would like PE . __eou__ I do like PE , but I am interested in science . __eou__ Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__ Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__ Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . __eou__ Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__
Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . __eou__ You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . __eou__
We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . __eou__ I guess we should start with nominees first . __eou__ Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . __eou__ We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . __eou__ Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that this afternoon . __eou__ Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? __eou__ Yes , let me put it on the calendar . __eou__
You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come . __eou__ I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . __eou__ Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking . __eou__ The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . __eou__ How about your one-year-old baby ? __eou__ I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . __eou__ How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . __eou__ When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? __eou__ It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . __eou__ Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . __eou__ Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . __eou__ I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . __eou__
Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . __eou__ How many credits for each course ? __eou__ Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . __eou__ Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . __eou__
How many credits are you taking this semester ? __eou__ I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . __eou__ What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? __eou__ Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . __eou__ If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? __eou__ I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . __eou__ Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I would like to return this book . __eou__ Is that all you need ? __eou__ I also want to check out this video . __eou__ Is that all you would like to check out ? __eou__ That ’ s all I need . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ Make sure to take proper care of this video . __eou__ That won ’ t be a problem . __eou__ If you damage the video , you will be fined . __eou__ I won ’ t damage it . __eou__
You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? __eou__ Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ They did . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ Seventy to sixty-seven . __eou__
Where should I park ? __eou__ Do you have a car or motorbike ? __eou__ I drive a scooter __eou__ In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? __eou__ No , I haven't seen those spots . __eou__ The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? __eou__ I park in the daytime . __eou__ Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? __eou__ No , I have not seen the signs . __eou__ Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? __eou__ No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . __eou__ Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go ! __eou__
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man . __eou__
Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . __eou__ How many credits for each course ? __eou__ Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . __eou__ Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . __eou__
I really like my debate class . __eou__ Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? __eou__ I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . __eou__ You want to be a politician ? Yuck . __eou__ That's not like you to generalize . __eou__ Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . __eou__ I think I can do a lot of good for our country . __eou__ You're right . We need more people like you in politics . __eou__
I am certain I am going to fail my English test . __eou__ Why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__ Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . __eou__ Only for this reason ? __eou__ Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . __eou__ Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . __eou__
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ? __eou__ No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done . __eou__ I'm done . __eou__ That looks great , but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I . D . __eou__ Sure , here it is . __eou__ Well , this looks nice . Do you know how to use it ? __eou__ I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? __eou__ Of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Well , I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits ! __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . __eou__ Thank you , please fill out this form for us . __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now ? __eou__ Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . __eou__
Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? __eou__ Yes , Ms . Jones . __eou__ Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class . __eou__
Mary , I've some bad news for you . __eou__ I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? __eou__ Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce . __eou__ Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
Who's that over here ? __eou__ That's the new teacher . __eou__ What do you think of the teacher ? __eou__ She's very nice . __eou__ What does she teach ? __eou__ English , of course . __eou__ Is she your teacher ? __eou__ Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . __eou__ Can she speak Chinese to her students ? __eou__ Not very much . __eou__ It's a good thing you can speak English ! __eou__
Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? __eou__ No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? __eou__ I'm feeling better today . __eou__ How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? __eou__ About more three days , I think . __eou__ OK . After three days , I will come to you for it . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Excuse me.Where do I register ? __eou__ Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . __eou__ Is that the large , white building ? __eou__ Yeah , that's it . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
That looks like an interesting book . __eou__ It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ What sports do they play there ? __eou__ It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ Is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What __eou__ Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . __eou__
I'll always remember my college days . __eou__ oh yeah ? __eou__ It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . __eou__ how did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . __eou__ what did you do after graduation ? __eou__ I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . __eou__ sounds like you're happy with your decision . __eou__ I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . __eou__ how could it be ? __eou__ while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . __eou__ you didn't have an offer ? __eou__ I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . __eou__ I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! __eou__
I got a ninety-five on my test . __eou__ So what ? I got a ninety-nine . __eou__
What can I do ? __eou__ Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . __eou__ Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? __eou__ Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . __eou__ All right . __eou__ Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . __eou__ These magazines are interesting .

Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . __eou__ Two waves ? __eou__ Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . __eou__ And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . __eou__
