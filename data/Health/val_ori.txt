What about a medication to help me with my problem ? __eou__ There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure . __eou__ What types of medications would be best ? __eou__ For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . __eou__ What are the side effects from taking that drug , __eou__ You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . __eou__ Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? __eou__ For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor . __eou__ Am I going to experience any complications with that drug ? __eou__ The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won ’ t experience anything negative . __eou__
