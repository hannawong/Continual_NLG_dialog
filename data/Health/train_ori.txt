How can I do that ? __eou__ One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__ When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__ You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight .

Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__ Great . Thanks for you advice ! __eou__

Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . __eou__ Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__ Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__ No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__ Ok , spit . __eou__
I have a sore throat and my chest hurts . __eou__ How long have you been like this ? __eou__ Two or three days now . __eou__ I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . __eou__ What do you think I ought to do ? __eou__ Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed . __eou__
Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor . __eou__ Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ? __eou__ I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at . __eou__ Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ? __eou__ No , but I have a low fever . __eou__ I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? __eou__ I want to come in on Wednesday . __eou__ I can fit you in on that day at 10 __eou__ I would prefer Dr . Smith . __eou__ You can see the doctor of your choice then , and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time . __eou__
Doctor , can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy ? __eou__ Well , first of all , you need to make sure that you eat the right foods . __eou__ What are the best foods to eat ? __eou__ You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein . __eou__ What should I avoid ? __eou__ You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine . __eou__ What else is important to stay healthy ? __eou__ You need to get plenty of exercise every day . If you smoke , you need to stop . __eou__ Is it OK to drink alcohol ? __eou__ Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink . __eou__
Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ? __eou__ I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts . __eou__ It sounds like you're coming down with something . __eou__
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . __eou__ You should go to the dentist . __eou__ I hate dentists . __eou__ Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__ It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__ Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__ O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . __eou__ Good . You'll feel better after you do . __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . __eou__ Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain . __eou__ When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? __eou__ First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . __eou__ I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__ It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
Excuse me . Miss , what does the doctor say about me ? When can I be discharged ? __eou__ The doctor has examined your current situation .

But how can I get discharged ? __eou__ First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered . __eou__ Yes , I will . Thanks for your care . __eou__

That set it off big time ! __eou__

I ’ ll see you tomorrow . __eou__

Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . __eou__ But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . __eou__ Is what you said really true ? __eou__ Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
How is the result of your lab test ? __eou__ When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . __eou__ Then say it . __eou__ When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said . __eou__ That ’ s just what I want to know . __eou__ He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me . __eou__
