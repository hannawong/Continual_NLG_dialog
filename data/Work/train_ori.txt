Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview . __eou__ That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . __eou__ I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? __eou__ It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet . __eou__ Good idea . It is convenient and fast . __eou__ You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . __eou__ I think that about one hundred words are enough . __eou__ After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply . __eou__ OK , I know now . __eou__

David , how is your interview ? __eou__ I was nervous at that time . What about you ? __eou__ Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . __eou__ We can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__ Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? __eou__ Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . __eou__ I am getting to know your meaning . __eou__

But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__ You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . __eou__ That ’ s something we can discuss later . __eou__
The bonus season is coming . How much of a bonus can I expect ? __eou__ I think you will get a big bonus , because you always have high sales . __eou__ I hope so .

Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . __eou__

Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . __eou__ I understand . Thank you . __eou__

Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best . __eou__ That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
Good morning . My name is Mr . Brown . I ’ m from Australia . Here is my card . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown .

I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . __eou__ Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . __eou__ Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__
Where do you see yourself three years from now ? __eou__ Working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm ! __eou__ Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? __eou__ Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . __eou__
I ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__ I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__ Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__ Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__ That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__ Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__ Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__ Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__ Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . __eou__

You look upset , anything wrong ? __eou__ I'm going to quit the job . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The task is tough . __eou__ You'd look before you leap . __eou__ Thanks for your concern . __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . __eou__
May I see the manager of your office ? __eou__ I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? __eou__ Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company .

Excuse me , is this the office of the Textile Corporation ? __eou__ Yes , What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm from CTC Trade Company . Here is my card . __eou__ Welcome to our corporation . I'm in charge of the export business . __eou__ I'm glad to meet you here . You're Ms . ... __eou__ I'm In Hui . Do sit down , won't you ? __eou__ Thank you , Ms . In . I'm here to discuss the possibility of establishing business relations with your corporation . __eou__ We'd be very glad to do so . Have you seen the exhibits displayed in the hall ? __eou__ Yes , I had a look around yesterday . I wish I could have them all . Can you give me a price list with specifications ? __eou__ Yes , of course . If you make an inquiry , we can make you a firm offer . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually ! __eou__
I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . __eou__
What's combined transportation ? __eou__ If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . __eou__ Why is it necessary ? __eou__ It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . __eou__
How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job ? __eou__ Work is work , whether it ’ s a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig . __eou__ So I guess I have to report that I ’ Ve found a little bit of work . __eou__ All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest . __eou__ What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks ? Can I take it ? __eou__ It is to your advantage to work as much as you can . __eou__
Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__ How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__ First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ How did I do ? __eou__ Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__ Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__ Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__ That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__ I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__ Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? __eou__
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__ It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . __eou__
How is the project going ? __eou__ Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . __eou__ Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__ I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__ Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . __eou__ I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . __eou__ And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__ I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__ Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . __eou__ That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . __eou__ We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . __eou__ Well , I will do it better . __eou__ If you have any problem in your work , let me know . __eou__ Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . __eou__
Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . __eou__ I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . __eou__ Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? __eou__ Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . __eou__ Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? __eou__ Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late . __eou__
Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? __eou__ Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? __eou__ This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember your company . __eou__ Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . __eou__ What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? __eou__ Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? __eou__ Any time you say is OK . __eou__ All right , expecting you . __eou__
Have you ever been involved in the auditing work ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated . I worked there for 3 years . Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years . __eou__ How long did it take you to become an auditor ? __eou__ Very short time . I became an auditor within three months . __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__ Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__ It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__
That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored . __eou__ If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ? __eou__ Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory . __eou__
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! __eou__ And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__ Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__ Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__ So , what did you win ? __eou__ A lousy desk lamp . And you ? __eou__ A bar of soap ! __eou__ Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! __eou__ Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . __eou__
This is our best product . __eou__ How long will it take to make five hundred ? __eou__ They'll be done before the end of the week . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? __eou__ A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . __eou__ What are the purposes of contract ? __eou__ In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc . __eou__ When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ? __eou__ Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity . __eou__
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__ Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__ Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__ Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__ Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__ I will do my best . __eou__
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? __eou__ Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__ What's he studying ? __eou__ He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__ Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__ The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ He just has his secretary do his homework for him . __eou__
Are you married ? __eou__ Yes , I've just married . __eou__ How long have you been married ? __eou__ I have been married for three years . __eou__ How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ There are four people in my family . __eou__ Who are the members of your family ? __eou__ My husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and I . __eou__
I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position . __eou__ Very well , do you know any shorthand ? __eou__ No , but I can write very fast . __eou__ Can you use the computer or other office machines ? __eou__ No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them . __eou__ Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . __eou__ Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? __eou__ Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . __eou__ I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . __eou__
How do we do timesheets here ? __eou__ They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? __eou__ Yes , I already have one . __eou__ OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? __eou__ I am kind of confused . __eou__ Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? __eou__ I'm not quite sure . __eou__ Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? __eou__ No , I have no idea what you are talking about . __eou__ It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__ Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . __eou__
Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing . __eou__ I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city . __eou__ Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ? __eou__ That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much . __eou__ It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near . __eou__ OK , let ’ s go . __eou__
Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . __eou__ Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . __eou__ Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? __eou__ Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . __eou__
Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__ Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__ Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__ Professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__ Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__ Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__ But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__ Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . __eou__ You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__ Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__ In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__ In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__ Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__ Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__ That ’ s not good for me at all . It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__ We must find some time to read report . __eou__ I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Do you have a free moment ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need ? __eou__ I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? __eou__ Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__ Silly me . __eou__ Now press this button . __eou__ Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__ Just a second . I'll go get some . __eou__
Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute . __eou__ Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . __eou__
Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ? __eou__ Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? __eou__ I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . __eou__ Really ? When will she come back ? __eou__ Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left . __eou__ Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . __eou__ Wait a minute . I have to leave a memo here . Anything else ? __eou__ The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible . __eou__ Dan , don't worry . I will tell her everything as soon as she comes back . __eou__
Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . __eou__ Is that difficult ? __eou__ Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . __eou__ That's all right . What can I do ? __eou__ Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . __eou__ Well . I can do it . And then ? __eou__ The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? __eou__ Who will pay for these things ? __eou__ Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . __eou__ OK . I will go in no time . __eou__
When can you give me the final decision ? __eou__ We'll notify you next Thursday at the latest . Shall I telephone you ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ All right . Thank you for coming today . __eou__ Thank you for your interview with me . __eou__
How do I know what forms to fill out for unemployment ? __eou__ There is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . __eou__ How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits ? __eou__ You can go online to begin the application process . __eou__ What type of information will I have to provide to the Employment Development Office ? __eou__ You need to be able to say whom you worked for and when . __eou__ Will they need anything else from me ? __eou__ You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance . __eou__ What should I do after I turn in the application ? __eou__ You need to be interviewed over the phone . They will set up a time for you . __eou__
I don't believe we've met . __eou__ No , I don't think we have . __eou__ My name is Gao Run . __eou__ How do you do ? My name is James Green . __eou__ Here's my name card . __eou__ And here's mine . __eou__ It's nice to finally meet you . __eou__ And I'm glad to meet you , too . __eou__
Can you help me with my timesheet ? __eou__ Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? __eou__ No , I don't know where to find one . __eou__ Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that . __eou__ Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? __eou__ No , I don't know what that is . __eou__ OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I understand how to do this . __eou__ After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . __eou__ That was easy ! __eou__ Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . __eou__
When could we meet to discuss the project ? __eou__ I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . __eou__ I prefer Monday . __eou__ Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? __eou__ Either one is OK . __eou__ Great ! When I check with the others , I will send you an exact time . When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . __eou__ I will be prepared to do my presentation . __eou__ Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? __eou__ Everyone needs to be there . __eou__ That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . __eou__ OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! __eou__
How many foreign languages can you speak ? __eou__ Only English . __eou__ What do you think of your English ? __eou__ I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator . __eou__ Can you speak English fluently ? __eou__ I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently . __eou__ Did you take TOEFL or GRE ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I got 600 in TOEFL and 2 , 300 in GRE . __eou__ When did you begin to learn English ? __eou__ I started to learn English when I was in primary school . __eou__ Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ? __eou__ The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Germany . __eou__ So you speak German , don't you ? __eou__ Yeah , but I can speak English , too . __eou__ Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? __eou__ A little French . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? __eou__ I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . __eou__ Then use the xerox machine . __eou__ It broke down one year ago . __eou__ Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__ The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__ Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__ What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__ Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__ I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . __eou__
Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment . __eou__ You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment . __eou__ Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ? __eou__ Yes , Mr.Forester . __eou__ When do you start the payment then ? __eou__ We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments . __eou__ We can accept that but you have to pay the interest . __eou__ All right . __eou__ Shall we sign the agreement now ? __eou__ Ok , let's sign it . __eou__
That is what we are pursuing . __eou__ We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . __eou__ A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff . __eou__ That will be good . __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure .

Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head .

So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... __eou__ We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__ That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__

How's the building work going ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . __eou__ What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage .

The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . __eou__ OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . __eou__

Where are you studying and what's your major ? __eou__ I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law . __eou__ Why did you choose Beijing University ? __eou__ Because Beijing University is the best university in China and I'm sure I am one of the best students . __eou__ What courses have you learned ? __eou__ I have learned many courses , such as Civil Law , Economic Law , Commercial Law and Administration Law . __eou__ Which one is your favorite ?

Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? __eou__ I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__ why ? __eou__ many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__ that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__ and there're higher salaries there . __eou__ well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__ I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__ one person ? How about your girlfriend ? __eou__ oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__ sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__ sure have .

You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . __eou__
What did you do at the office today ? __eou__ I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices . __eou__ I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__ I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements . __eou__ It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . __eou__ I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ You certainly had a busy day . __eou__ That ’ s not all !

Tell them you are going for a job interview . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Buy a decent suit . __eou__ Is a white blouse OK ? __eou__ Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . __eou__ How about make up ? __eou__ Not much make up . __eou__
Good morning , Wilson Association . __eou__ This is Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr.Tomas . __eou__ I'm sorry , but Mr.Tomas left here just a few minutes ago . __eou__ I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line was busy . Will he be back soon ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . He is away for the rest of the day . __eou__ Is there any other way I can reach him ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . May I take a message ? __eou__ I have a business appointment with him at ten o'clock tomorrow morning , but I'm afraid I can't make it . __eou__ Would you like to make another appointment ? __eou__ Unfortunately , I'm leaving here unexpectedly , and I may be away for several days . __eou__ I see . I'll tell Mr.Tomas you've called . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . __eou__ Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__ No , I probably need to do some more research . __eou__ When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? __eou__ I think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__ So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? __eou__ I have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__ You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__ Yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__ Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__
I'm calling to tell you the shipment has arrived in good condition . __eou__ That's good ! This is our first transaction . I hope you'll be entirely satisfied with this initial shipment . __eou__ Quite satisfied . I'm looking forward to our future cooperation . __eou__
Do you have a moment ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need ? __eou__ I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? __eou__ Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__ Silly me ! __eou__ Now press this button . __eou__ Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__ Just a second . I'll go get some . Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them . __eou__ Which one is this ? __eou__ It's the Canon . __eou__
Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__ People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__ Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . __eou__

How was your interview ? __eou__ Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . __eou__ What did you say ? __eou__ I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . __eou__ Did he want to know the reasons ? __eou__ Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . __eou__ That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? __eou__ In a couple of days , I was told . __eou__ Wish you good luck ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ? __eou__ Yes .

What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ? __eou__ OK , thanks a lot . See you then . __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave . __eou__ Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting .

You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__ Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__ Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ?

This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__ Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . __eou__
You know that this job requires frequent business travel .

Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? __eou__ It is 9 o'clock now . __eou__ I see . What is today's schedule ? __eou__ You have two meetings today .

Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning .

I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends .

Has my package arrived ? __eou__ I'm not sure . What does it look like ? __eou__ It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . __eou__ There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . __eou__
Hi , Steven , take a seat !

Dear fellows . As you know , Mr . Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company . __eou__ I really want to stay a little longer , but I still have a meeting to attend . All in all , I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome . Thank you for the trouble you have taken . __eou__ Just as what I said in my welcome speech , Mr . Ross's visit to our company is meaningful for both our two companies . Thank you very much for your visiting . We will miss you all the time . __eou__ During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful . __eou__ That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . __eou__ Of course , I will . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , and how are you ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . __eou__ How are you getting along with your business ? __eou__ Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . __eou__ I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . __eou__
If we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ? __eou__ I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month . __eou__ I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . __eou__ Does it include bonuses ? __eou__ No , there are annual bonuses , one week paid vacation a year , and health insurance . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
how's your job search going ? __eou__ I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? __eou__ I've only found a few openings in my field . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . __eou__ there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? __eou__ unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . __eou__ that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__ really ? what is it ? __eou__ it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__ that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__ well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! __eou__ that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? __eou__ sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! __eou__
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__ For the bank manager ? __eou__ That ’ s the one . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__ Well , no surprise there . __eou__ No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__ Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ I ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__ Great ! Good luck . __eou__ And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__ Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . __eou__
It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? __eou__ We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . __eou__ But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now . __eou__ Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . __eou__ I've been fed up with study . __eou__ But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . __eou__ Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? __eou__ You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . __eou__
We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . __eou__ Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__ This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__ If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__ Then , what's your countr-offer ? __eou__ This is our counter-offer . __eou__ We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__ So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__ How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__ Agreed . __eou__
Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . __eou__ I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__ Well , why should we hire you ? __eou__ I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . __eou__ Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . __eou__ Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . __eou__
Bruno's . __eou__ Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant . __eou__ Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ? __eou__ There will be about 18 people . __eou__ Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . __eou__ Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ? __eou__ No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge . __eou__ That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne .

Do you have somebody in mind ? __eou__ Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you . __eou__ OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . __eou__ Don't sweat it . I know just the guy . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__ That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__ Ok , good luck to you . __eou__
Excuse me , young man ? __eou__ Yes , ma ’ am ? __eou__ Could you point me in the direction of the bank ? I ’ Ve lost my way . __eou__ Certainly , ma ’ am . Just take these stairs down to the first floor and turn left . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__
Excuse me , is this personnel division ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . __eou__ What ’ s your name ? __eou__ My name is Li Jean . __eou__ You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? __eou__ Yes , seven years . __eou__ What degree do you have now ? : __eou__ Master of Marketing Management . __eou__ Do you have any experience in this field ? __eou__ Yes . I worked at AB Company . __eou__ Why are you interested in the position ? __eou__ Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . __eou__ All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? __eou__ That's very good . __eou__

This is for all the marbles . __eou__ When do you need it ? __eou__ ASAP , in writing of course . __eou__ Sure , who am I bidding against ? __eou__ The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . __eou__ Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . __eou__

Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... __eou__ You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang .

Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__ Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__ He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . __eou__
Liz , do you have a minute ? __eou__ Yes , of course . What is it ? __eou__ I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . __eou__ Okay , what should I do ? __eou__ Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday . __eou__ Good . So you will have no trouble finding it . __eou__ What's the presentation about ? __eou__ I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff . __eou__ Will you need anything special for the presentation ? __eou__ Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . __eou__ I suppose you need the whiteboard set up . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Come in , please . __eou__ I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__ In 3 months or so . __eou__ You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__ Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__ You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__ Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__ I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__ I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__ Very well , consider me gone . __eou__
Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ? __eou__ I cut it on that blade . __eou__ I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there . __eou__
Are there any vacancies still available ? __eou__ Yes . We need a plumber here . __eou__ I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . __eou__ I am sorry . They are not available now . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
Good morning . Please come into my office . __eou__ Good morning . Thank you . __eou__ I see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__ Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I'm also in the process of writing my first novel . __eou__ Wonderful . I'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Zhang . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ How are you ? How nice to see you again . How is everything going ? __eou__ Very well . What about you ? __eou__ Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here . __eou__ That is so nice of you . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Smith . Would you like to see around the factory ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to . __eou__ This is our office block . We have all the administrative department here , Sales , Accounts , Personnel , Market Research and so on . __eou__
How do you do , Mr . Johnson ? I'm Thomas . __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper . __eou__ OK . What's your working experience ? __eou__ I have worked for IBM for three years . __eou__ How do your experiences benefit our company ? __eou__ I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you . __eou__ Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ? __eou__ Yes , I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company . __eou__ If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ? __eou__ If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department . __eou__ Then , what starting salary do you expect ? __eou__ I'd like to start at RIB 4,000 a month . __eou__

Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs .

However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__ even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__ that ’ s correct . __eou__ that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__ well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__ I see .

Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__ Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? __eou__ OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__ That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__ Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__ Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__ You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__

I had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__ did you get to leave early then ? __eou__ my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__ it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . __eou__ let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__ it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__ you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__ I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__ what ’ s that ? __eou__ I got sacked today . __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__ well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__ how late were you ? __eou__ only about 5 minutes . __eou__ you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__ my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__ oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? __eou__
Could I help you on your new project ? __eou__ I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work . Which would you prefer ? __eou__ I want to help with both . __eou__ That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ? __eou__ Most of the time that is what I prefer . __eou__ We start on Monday . Can you be there ? __eou__ I am not sure yet . __eou__ I need your background information before the meeting . __eou__ I will do that . __eou__ I'll enjoy working with you .

In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation . __eou__ I'm not sure if that would be wise . __eou__ Then what is your opinion ? __eou__ Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . __eou__
Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department . __eou__ All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues . __eou__ You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding . __eou__ I just did what I should have done . __eou__ You ’ Ve got a great personality . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments .

What ’ s up ? __eou__ I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form __eou__ I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__ Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . __eou__ OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? __eou__ Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . __eou__

This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . __eou__ Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . __eou__ Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . __eou__ It looks like you guys work hard . __eou__ I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . __eou__ Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . __eou__ Sure thing . __eou__
Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper . __eou__ Which ad would that be ? __eou__ For the job . __eou__ Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . __eou__ Oh ! It was for a market sale manager . Is that still available ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? __eou__ What company is this for ? I mean where's the opening ? __eou__ We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . __eou__ Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . __eou__ So you're a headhunter . __eou__ We're an Employment Agency . __eou__
Are you a goal-oriented person ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . __eou__ Where do you want to be in 5 years ? __eou__ I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . __eou__ That sounds very reasonable . __eou__ It's the most important thing to me . __eou__ If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? __eou__ That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . __eou__ Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . __eou__ I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . __eou__ What is your long-range objective ? __eou__ I haven't thought it over at all . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? __eou__ I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . __eou__
Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . __eou__ Let ’ s see ...

The negotiation of the price has taken us a long time . I hope the following negotiation about quality will be quicker . __eou__ I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations . __eou__ Don't worry . Our quality is based solely on our sales samples . __eou__ But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ? __eou__ We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones . __eou__ That's great . __eou__

Smith . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Smith . __eou__
Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . __eou__ Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . __eou__

Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? __eou__ Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . __eou__ How about your nursing education ? __eou__ I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . __eou__ Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . __eou__
What companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ? __eou__ Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . __eou__ What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? __eou__ I wish to work in the planning department . __eou__ What type of work will you expect to do at first ? __eou__ I expect to operate computers . __eou__ What are your plans for the future ? __eou__ I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . __eou__ How long does it take to get here from your home ? __eou__ It's a twenty-minute bus ride . __eou__ How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? __eou__ I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . __eou__ You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? __eou__ I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . __eou__ Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ What ideas do you have if we employ you ? __eou__ Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . __eou__ Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . __eou__ If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? __eou__ I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . __eou__ If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . __eou__ What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? __eou__ People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . __eou__ What are your expectations from working on this job ? __eou__ Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . __eou__ If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? __eou__ I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . __eou__ If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . __eou__
Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? __eou__ I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . __eou__ I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . __eou__ To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . __eou__ Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Kramer . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ That ’ s about all I can spare , Karen . What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new secretary you ’ Ve hired . I think I ’ m going to have some problems working with her . __eou__ She seems to be quite qualified . If it ’ s a personal problem , I ’ d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves . __eou__
I was wondering if you need any help on your new project . __eou__ Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ? __eou__ I would like to help with the computer work . __eou__ Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ? __eou__ Yes , I like working like that . __eou__ We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ? __eou__ Yes , I can be there . __eou__ Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful . __eou__ OK , I will send the information to you . __eou__ Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day ! __eou__
Thank you for calling ABC company , may I help you ? __eou__ I'm Lui , I'd like to Speak to Mr . Smiths . __eou__ Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and Jim Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? __eou__ I'd like to speak to Mr Robert Smith . __eou__ He is on the line . __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__ We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__ Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . __eou__
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . __eou__ Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__ No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . __eou__
How do you like your job here , Linda ? __eou__ It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__ I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__ I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__ Do you have any complaints ? __eou__ No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? __eou__ Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__ That's perfect . I will definitely do well . __eou__

I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together . __eou__ It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ? __eou__ I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . __eou__ Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__ I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price . __eou__ Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__ What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . __eou__ As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . __eou__ You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . __eou__ We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . __eou__
How are your Chinese and English ? __eou__ I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . __eou__ How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? __eou__ I believe every company has its own salary criterion .

Hi , this is ABC Company . Is that Joseph ? __eou__ Yes , speaking . Anything I can do for you ? __eou__ I am calling to tell you that the interview for you is in our company on Monday morning at 8: 00 . __eou__ Where is the interview happening ? __eou__ It is on the Jianshe Street where there is a Carrefour Supermarket near it . __eou__
What is my prime responsibility in daily work ? __eou__ Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ What other things do I need to know ? __eou__ You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that . __eou__ No problem . I am used to it . __eou__
What's wrong ? __eou__ There's no power . __eou__ Have you checked the fuse box ? __eou__ Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . __eou__ There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . __eou__
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? __eou__ We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__ No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__ We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__ Are you kidding ? __eou__ No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__

What type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__ I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__ What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__ I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__ What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__ The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__ Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure ... what's up ? __eou__ Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . __eou__ Sure ... __eou__ Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__ Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ Interesting idea . You might be on to something . __eou__
Are you familiar with the office management ? __eou__ I have done something like that before . __eou__ Are you still interested in it ? __eou__ I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . __eou__
Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today . __eou__ Yes .

But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . __eou__ How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__ That'll be fine . __eou__
Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ? __eou__ As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future . __eou__ How do you plan to accomplish this ? __eou__ By doing everything necessary and for further study . __eou__ How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__ How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other . __eou__ What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ? __eou__ I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time . __eou__
Greetings should never be ignored in the interview . __eou__ Sure . It is helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere . __eou__ Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression __eou__ But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes . __eou__ In the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile . __eou__ In the interview , use polite words , such as ' Thank you ' , or ' Please ' . __eou__ That's right . Details can mean succeed or fail . __eou__ When talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . __eou__ At the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say Goode . __eou__ Whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor . __eou__ Only in this way can you leave a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ In short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview . __eou__
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__ Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__ Thank you for telling me that . __eou__ But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__ What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__ Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__ I got it . __eou__ Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Is there any way of ensuring we'll have enough time for our talks ? __eou__ I am sure we do have . __eou__ So our evenings will be quite full then ? __eou__ If you want some changes , just tell me . __eou__

Ltd . __eou__ What type of position are you looking for ? __eou__ I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . __eou__ Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? __eou__ I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . __eou__ Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? __eou__ I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . __eou__ What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . __eou__ What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . __eou__ Why do you want to work for our company ? __eou__ After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . __eou__ When can you begin ? __eou__ Immediately . __eou__
Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ? __eou__ Well , if you can meet our deadline . __eou__ That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . __eou__ I also hope your quality will meet our standard . __eou__ We never fail to meet our client's expectation . __eou__ Excellent .

That's just the job that I have been looking for __eou__
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ How regular ? __eou__ An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ You are kidding me ?

They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__

The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . __eou__ How ? __eou__ If you know somebody at the company , ask them .

He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__ I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__ I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__ there's an opening in the creative design department .

You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__ Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it .

Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ? __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . __eou__ I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . __eou__ Yes , I often do business through internet now . __eou__ Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? __eou__ Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . __eou__ What advantages does it have ? __eou__ Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . __eou__ I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . __eou__ The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . __eou__ So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__ Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__ Will you give me some suggestion ? __eou__ Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__ Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . __eou__
Why have you decided to change jobs ? __eou__ I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__ Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__ Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__ It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . __eou__ I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__ Do you mind going on frequent business trips ? __eou__ No , I enjoy travelling . __eou__
Do you give me a bonus ? __eou__ Yes . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses . __eou__ Do you allow any commission ? __eou__ Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . __eou__ Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__ Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . __eou__ No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . __eou__ But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . __eou__ Oh , no one is perfect . __eou__ That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . __eou__ We have the equal partnership in team . __eou__ Thanks very much and you're very eloquent . __eou__ Thanks for saying that . __eou__

What do you think are some important considerations going into your interview ? __eou__ I think that we should dress neatly and appropriately . __eou__ Yes . Second , as you can imagine , attitude and friendliness go a long way . __eou__ Yes , and I always feel much better when I am friendly . __eou__ Believe it or not , the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers . __eou__ Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview ? __eou__ Always be honest with your answers . The interviewers really do want to know if you will be a good fit for them . __eou__
Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ? __eou__ We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider . __eou__

We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
We are very interested in your printed pure silk scarves , so could you introduce us your prices ? __eou__ Thank you for inquiring .

Mr . Tang , we have decided to hire you . How much do you expect to get a month ? __eou__ I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ? __eou__ I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary . __eou__ You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience . __eou__ Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car . __eou__ But I have my own car and my own house . __eou__ OK , 4000 yuan a month . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Not at all , it's reasonable . __eou__

Smith . __eou__ Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also . __eou__ I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers .

Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ How did the business trip go ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ No , should I have ? __eou__

Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes , but why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I'd delighted if you did . __eou__
What would be my daily duties ? __eou__ Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors . __eou__ Got it . To whom should I report ? __eou__ Of course to me . __eou__
What kind of job are you interested in ? __eou__ I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . __eou__ I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . __eou__ Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . __eou__ Have you had any experience as a guide ? __eou__ Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . __eou__ Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . __eou__ I think I would like that . __eou__
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__ Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__ Thank you for telling me that . __eou__ But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__ What are they ?

Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? __eou__ Well , I'm not too happy about it . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted .

Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that is very important . __eou__ Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . __eou__ I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . __eou__ I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__ Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__ You ’ d better not .

Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do .

She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ Well , what about price ? __eou__ The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . __eou__

To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next month .

Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that's very important . __eou__ So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__ I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__ It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__ But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__ I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__ You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__ You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__ It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__ It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__
Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming . __eou__ When can I contact you about your final decision ? __eou__ We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning . __eou__ Well , I really appreciate your coming today . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . __eou__ Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? __eou__ I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese . __eou__ Why would you like to work with us ? __eou__ It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . __eou__ Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , A great oak needs deep roots . I ’ m really interested in this job . __eou__ That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . __eou__
Excuse me , Alex ? __eou__ What can I do for you , Kim ? __eou__ I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . __eou__ Sure , anytime . __eou__
Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager . __eou__ How do you do , Mr . Smith ? My name is Thou Hong . __eou__ Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products . __eou__ Will you please take a seat ? Mr . Smith , have you seen the display of our electronic products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? __eou__ Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we __eou__ Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . __eou__ So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America . __eou__ Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? __eou__ Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . __eou__ Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? __eou__ No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . __eou__ What's your strong points ? __eou__ Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . __eou__ What do you dislike most about your job ? __eou__ Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . __eou__ What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? __eou__ A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . __eou__ Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__ Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__ How do you feel about overtime work ? __eou__ That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . __eou__ What is most important to you in a job ? __eou__ I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . __eou__ Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . __eou__ Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? __eou__ Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . __eou__ OK . What are your strong points ? __eou__ Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . __eou__ And your weaknesses ? __eou__ I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . __eou__
There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . __eou__ I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . __eou__ We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . __eou__
Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . __eou__ That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . __eou__ That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? __eou__ The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . __eou__ Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__ Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . __eou__ I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . __eou__

I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__ Have you decided ? __eou__ Yes , I want to get a better job . __eou__ Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__ I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__ Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out . __eou__ I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__ OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__
Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position __eou__ The question is we only need one . __eou__ Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__ I should take the taller one for the choice . __eou__

What kind of jobs have you had ? __eou__ I have been a Production Manager . __eou__ How many years have you worked as a Production Manager ? __eou__ 3 years . __eou__ Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? __eou__ I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . __eou__ Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , three . If your company employs me , it will be my fourth . __eou__ Then have you received any award at your present company ? __eou__ Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year . __eou__ How would you evaluate the company you are with ? __eou__ Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances . __eou__ How would your colleagues evaluate you ? __eou__ They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . __eou__ Can you get recommendations from your present employers ? __eou__ Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__ Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__ Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__ That ’ s not good for me at all . It'll have to be another time . __eou__ We must find some time to read report . __eou__ I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__ See you . __eou__

I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . __eou__ What kind of people do you like to work with ? __eou__ People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . __eou__
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ What is the tariff ? __eou__ It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__ Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__ Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__ Anything else . __eou__ Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__ Do not mention it . __eou__
I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . __eou__ Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__ Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . __eou__
Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__ Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__ In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__ What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__ It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__ Our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . __eou__
Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__ That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__ Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__ According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__ How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__ From 11:30 to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__ May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__ Sometimes , but not quite often . __eou__
Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him . __eou__ Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ?

How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? __eou__ That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins . __eou__ It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . __eou__ OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second . __eou__ Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? __eou__ We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st . __eou__ Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . __eou__ Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments . __eou__ Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . __eou__ I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__ Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . __eou__
morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week . __eou__ Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week . __eou__ Fine , Mr .

What experience do you have with office machinery ? __eou__ I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor .

I think I'll take the job . __eou__
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__ But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__ It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__ Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person .

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__ I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . __eou__ Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? __eou__ I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . __eou__ How do you work with a team ? __eou__ I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . __eou__ What ’ s your long term goal ? __eou__ I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty . A sincere desire to become an administrative assistant is the heart of my career plans . __eou__
I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . __eou__ You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__ To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__ interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__ That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__ Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__ I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled __eou__ So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . __eou__
What do you think about the equipment in our company ? __eou__ We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . __eou__ I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential . __eou__ Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . __eou__ Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management . __eou__ And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . __eou__ You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . __eou__
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th __eou__
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step . __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right ? __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . __eou__
We are sorry to bring you so much trouble . __eou__ We hope that this dispute can be settled through friendly negotiation without its being submitted for arbitration . __eou__ Yes . That's what we want . __eou__
No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . __eou__ With invoking ? No , thanks . __eou__ I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . __eou__ I'm not interested , Zina . __eou__ Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . __eou__

I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . __eou__ Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . __eou__ I know , Janet . I just walked out and forgot it completely . I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ? __eou__
Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . __eou__ Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . __eou__ I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . __eou__ I see.OK , that's agreed then . __eou__
Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? __eou__ I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . Moreover , I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience . __eou__ Great .

Here it is . __eou__ Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs ? __eou__ Of course , I designed a more powerful gasoline engine , which greatly increased the speed of limousines . __eou__
I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? __eou__ Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . __eou__ What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . __eou__ Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__ What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__ The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__ You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__ It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__ I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . __eou__ That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__ I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__ Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__
Evan , are you busy right now ? __eou__ Not really . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I need a hand with the fax machine . My fax is not going through . __eou__ I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . __eou__ Ah , thanks . __eou__
Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . __eou__ Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . __eou__ What can I do next ? __eou__ The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . __eou__ Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? __eou__ Maybe we should call its after-service man . __eou__
We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes . __eou__ We are interested in this field . __eou__ Please inform us of your decision as soon as possible . __eou__
The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! __eou__ I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__ That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? __eou__ Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . __eou__
Mr.James . I know that office hour is up now , but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations ? __eou__ Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ... __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry.However , if you could help me out , I'll double the pay for the hours worked . __eou__ That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them ? __eou__ I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ? __eou__ I'll try . __eou__ Thank you very much , Mr.James . __eou__
Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? __eou__ According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months . __eou__ What is the salary while on probation ? __eou__ In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month . __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__ The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance . __eou__ Are there paid holidays ? __eou__ Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year . __eou__
Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__ My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . __eou__
I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson . __eou__ Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ? __eou__ This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ? __eou__ OK , I'll tell him . __eou__
Hi ! May I help you ? __eou__ Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . __eou__ In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . __eou__ No wonder . __eou__ Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
What sort of experience do you have ? __eou__ I used to work as a mechanic and I was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles . __eou__ Where was your last job ? __eou__ I worked in Hanson Paper Company . __eou__ Why did you quit your last job ? __eou__ Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday . __eou__
What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I'm quite outgoing , I think . __eou__ Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don't agree with someone else's opinion if I think he's wrong , but when I understand his thinking and see he has some good ideas , then I'm very happy to go along with him . __eou__

But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__

They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . __eou__

Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . __eou__ Can I take a look at one of those ? __eou__ Be my guest .

Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure , Just push the button , like ... __eou__ I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese !

What's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__ This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__ Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__ Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__ Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__

We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__ OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__
It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties . __eou__ Yes . We're satisfied with the result . __eou__ I hope that we can continue our cooperation . __eou__

What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course .

Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__ This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . __eou__

I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__ Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__ Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__ We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__ So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__ We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . __eou__
So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
Do you need any help ? __eou__ I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ? __eou__ I like xeroxing . __eou__ Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . __eou__ OK , I will get right to that . __eou__ I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? __eou__ I just started working here . __eou__ I have a special assignment coming up .

I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__ Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__

But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office . __eou__ Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . __eou__ I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time . __eou__ Come on ! What are you nervous about ? __eou__ It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . __eou__ But the sale number is close to the predicted amount . __eou__ I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place . __eou__ Take it easy . Be confident . I'm sure you can do it . __eou__

Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us . __eou__ That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry . __eou__ We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . __eou__ So do I . __eou__

Which university did you graduate from ? __eou__ I graduated from Peking University . __eou__ What was your major at university ? __eou__ I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China . __eou__ What course did you like best ? __eou__ I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work . __eou__ What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ? __eou__ I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . __eou__
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . __eou__ You mean you can read and write both of them ? __eou__ No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . __eou__ Can you read and write English well ? __eou__ I can speak the language better than read and write . __eou__ Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? __eou__ I think so .

Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . __eou__ So the company will pay for everything ? __eou__ Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__ That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . __eou__

Let's keep eating ! __eou__ Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . __eou__ All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! __eou__
Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! __eou__ I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . __eou__ So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? __eou__ Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . __eou__ So what would your role in the company ? __eou__ Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . __eou__ Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? __eou__ Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance .

Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . __eou__ You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? __eou__
Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal . __eou__ Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? __eou__ That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? __eou__
Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . __eou__ Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . __eou__ Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__ What are you thinking about ? __eou__ We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . __eou__ Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? __eou__ If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you . __eou__
Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? __eou__ Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . __eou__ We ’ Ve all enjoyed being with you . When will you come back ? __eou__ Sometime next year . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . Take care . __eou__ The same to you . Keep in touch . __eou__
Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__ I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ What's your proposal then ? __eou__ I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__ What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__ Ok . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? __eou__ Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position .

So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__ Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__ What did that involve ? __eou__ Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__ I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , okay . __eou__
Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies . __eou__ Well , I like reading , walking , swimming , hiking and playing basketball __eou__ You have a colorful life . __eou__ Yes .

The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__ Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__ Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__ Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__ Well , I will try . __eou__

A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
Good morning . Elly company . __eou__ Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ? __eou__ Hold on , please . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you like something to drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__ So , you're a serious coffee drinker . __eou__ Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__ Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__ No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__ Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__ I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__ I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__ It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ What do you suggest ? __eou__ The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ Well . __eou__ I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__ I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__

Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five ! __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office . __eou__ Okay . The sooner the better . __eou__ You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? __eou__
I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . __eou__ How many workers are there on the lines ? __eou__ About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . __eou__ Oh , it's highly efficient . __eou__ Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . __eou__ How do you control the quality of the products ? __eou__ Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . __eou__ Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . __eou__ Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__ Good morning , Mrs Smith . __eou__ Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__ I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? __eou__ In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . __eou__ Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? __eou__ No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . __eou__ From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . __eou__ I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . __eou__ You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . __eou__ No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . __eou__ That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? __eou__ I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . __eou__ Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? __eou__ No , can you tell me about it ? __eou__ Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . __eou__ I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? __eou__ I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . __eou__ Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . __eou__ The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . __eou__ Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? __eou__ I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? __eou__
Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ? __eou__ Sure , Emily . How can I help you ? __eou__ I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ? __eou__ That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave . __eou__
Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check . __eou__ Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ? __eou__ Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them . __eou__ Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . __eou__ I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ? __eou__ Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
My name is James Owen . I ’ m Manager of Sales . How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ Thank you for coming . Did you have any trouble finding the office ? __eou__ Oh , no . It was easy . Your office sent me a map . __eou__ I apologize for this mess . They ’ Ve got me handling so many projects , and it ’ s hard to keep things organized . __eou__ That ’ s OK . Thank you for seeing me . __eou__ Well . Miss Sun , as you know , we are looking for an executive secretary with good English skills and some business background . We looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ’ re comfortable , let's begin . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hello , sir . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I want to apply for a job you posted on the Internet yesterday . __eou__ What ’ s the job title ? __eou__ Service Technician . How can I apply for this position ? __eou__ You need to fill out an Application Form . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is on the desk over there . Be sure to fill out everything . Don ’ t leave any blank spaces . When you ’ re done bring the application to me . __eou__ Okay . Thanks . __eou__
So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? __eou__ Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! __eou__ That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__ What was so bad about it ? __eou__ Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . __eou__ Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . __eou__ Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . __eou__
morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . __eou__ Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? __eou__ Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! __eou__ Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . __eou__
I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits . __eou__ Did you get laid off ? __eou__ I am still working for now , but I might get laid off . __eou__ You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off . __eou__ Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment ? __eou__ No , some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment . __eou__ How can I find out if I can collect ? __eou__ Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect . __eou__ How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment ? __eou__ It depends on how much you earned . When you file , they will determine the amount . __eou__
Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? __eou__ Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... __eou__ Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . __eou__ You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? __eou__ Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . __eou__ Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . __eou__ But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . __eou__ Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . __eou__
All of you have reported your achievements . I'd like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face . __eou__ The same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us . __eou__ Yes , we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition . __eou__ It's the time to emphasize sense of crises . __eou__
If I understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . Is that correct ? __eou__ Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ? __eou__ I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . __eou__ Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . __eou__ Could you elaborate on that ? __eou__ Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . __eou__ Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms . __eou__
How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ Do you mind if I introduce myself ? My name is Wang Li . __eou__ My name is Jim Jones . Are you coming for the interview ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__
Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement . __eou__ Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? __eou__ Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . __eou__ OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . __eou__ Can we add up this item to the agreement ? __eou__ Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? __eou__ Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . __eou__ Thank you . I'll work hard . __eou__
sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this . __eou__ What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ? __eou__ It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ? __eou__
Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . __eou__ OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? __eou__ Yes , I'll talk to her . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . __eou__ That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? __eou__ I'm positive , Ms . Chen . __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
Is it possible that I have a business trip abroad and work in American once in a while ? __eou__ Yes . We are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad . __eou__ Is there any training program for the employees to make a further study ? __eou__ Sure . We attach great importance to the all-round development of the staff , and the development of individuals will motivate them to work more diligently and efficiently . __eou__
Good morning.My name's Pat Green . __eou__ Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ? __eou__ I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant . __eou__ Yes.Are you interested in the job ? __eou__ I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ? __eou__ Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ? __eou__ I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school . __eou__ Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ? __eou__ How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ? __eou__ Ten hours a week.From Monday to Friday , from 4 to 6 P . m . , and $ 150 a week . __eou__ OK , I'll take it . __eou__ Fine.Please fill out the application form . __eou__

Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting . __eou__ Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . __eou__ How long did the meeting last ? __eou__ The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . __eou__ Did the chairman ask for me ? __eou__ Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . __eou__ All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . __eou__ Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? __eou__ No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . __eou__
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . __eou__ I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__ I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . __eou__ But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . __eou__ I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . __eou__
Tell me a little bit about yourself , please . __eou__ My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July .

In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system __eou__ Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__ I see myself in a management position . __eou__
Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? __eou__ Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? __eou__ Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . __eou__ I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . __eou__ I am sure that document was filed . __eou__ Well , let me check again under a different heading . __eou__ Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . __eou__ Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Come in , please . __eou__ I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__ In 3 months or so . __eou__ You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__ Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__ You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__ Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times.and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__ I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__ I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__ Very well , consider me gone . __eou__
Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ? __eou__ Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you . __eou__ No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . __eou__ Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? __eou__ OK . I ’ m 24 this year .

I enjoy doing more challenging work . __eou__ Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . __eou__ Of course .

I ’ m sure I can do the job well . __eou__
Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ? __eou__ You should wear a tie to go with your suit . __eou__ I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself . __eou__
If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . __eou__ It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__ Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . __eou__
How do I make a good impression in the interview ? __eou__ You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . __eou__ What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . __eou__ Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Try to be natural , alert and interested . __eou__ You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure . Good luck to you . __eou__

So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English __eou__ I see . __eou__ Your approval would be my honor . __eou__

I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . __eou__ What kind of work ? __eou__ I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical company . __eou__ What do you do there ? __eou__ Mostly office work - filing and so on . __eou__ How long is the assignment ? __eou__ Till the end of the month . __eou__
Jack , I don't know how to write my resume .

It is the position desired __eou__ Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience . __eou__ I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . __eou__ Don't worry . It will take time to accumulate experience . You need to be confident for yourself . __eou__ I see . By the way , should I write the educational background starting from elementary school ? __eou__ Generally from the college __eou__ Thank you very much . I will write it right now . __eou__

I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__ But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__ Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__ Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__ Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ Sounds a great opportunity .

Can you tell me what the problem is over the phone or would you like me to go to your office ? __eou__
Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ? __eou__ I am sorry . I can ’ t hear your very clearly . Could you say that again , please ? __eou__ Does Mark Wyatt work there ? __eou__ Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible.Could you spell that for me , please ? __eou__ W-Y-A-T-T , Mark Wyatt . __eou__ W-Y-A-T-T , Got it . I haven ’ t heard of the name.Could you hold on the line when I check . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I feel my greatest asset is perseverance , that is , the ability to stick to things to get them done . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned . __eou__
My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . __eou__ Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . __eou__ You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . __eou__ Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me . __eou__
Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? __eou__ Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . __eou__ How should I contact them ? __eou__ You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . __eou__ Can I get a quick reply from the sites ? __eou__ Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . __eou__
My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__ Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__ Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
Excuse me . Mr . Emory ? __eou__ Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ? __eou__ I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment . __eou__ Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book . __eou__
I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . __eou__ Are you sure you're using the right program ? __eou__ Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . __eou__ That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Yang . I'm Jill , Mr . Smith's secretary . Would you like to look around the factory first ? __eou__ Yes , I would . __eou__ Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . __eou__ What's that building opposite us ? __eou__ That's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored . We keep a stock of the fast-moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . ( in the workshop ) This is one of our three workshops . This is the delivery bay here . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ I'll take you to the assembly shop ... __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__ I know , but I am really sick . __eou__ Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__ I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas __eou__
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__ Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__ Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__ Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ? __eou__ That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__ The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__ I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__ Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . __eou__
Hi , Cole . What can I do for you ? __eou__ if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company . __eou__ sure , have a seat . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ? __eou__ I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . __eou__ one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ? __eou__ yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . __eou__ I see . What job did you have in mind . __eou__ well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . __eou__ do you understand what duties that job would entail ? __eou__ yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . __eou__ that's right . Do you have any experience in management ? __eou__ yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . __eou__ well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in __eou__ ok . Thanks for your support . __eou__
You did an excellent job in this project . __eou__ Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it . __eou__ Congratulations . __eou__ When will you give me a raise ? __eou__ Ha ... I am not sure . __eou__ I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly . __eou__ Let me think . How much did you have in mind ? __eou__ 5 000 yuan per month . __eou__ That's a lot of money . Let me think about it carefully . __eou__
Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . __eou__ Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! __eou__ Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . __eou__ Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
May I speak to Marry ? __eou__ She's in a meeting until noon . __eou__ Ok , I'll try her back then . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . __eou__ Good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__ I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . __eou__ Very well . __eou__ How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? __eou__ About five years . __eou__ And how many staff do you employ ? __eou__ There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . __eou__ So this is a family business . __eou__ Yes , we are a small family business . __eou__ And how many computers do you sell each day ? __eou__ That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week . __eou__ That about one hundred a month . __eou__ That's correct . __eou__ Thank you B for your time . __eou__ Thank you and goodbye . __eou__
To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? __eou__ First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . __eou__ Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . __eou__ Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? __eou__ Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? __eou__ Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . __eou__ That's exactly my understanding . __eou__ Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . __eou__
Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . __eou__ Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . __eou__ Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . __eou__ But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__ Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__ Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? __eou__ This afternoon . __eou__
Please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing . __eou__ Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ? __eou__ Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years . __eou__ That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly . __eou__ Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time . __eou__ What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ? __eou__ To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day . __eou__ That can be a rough job , you know . __eou__ Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . __eou__ Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ? __eou__ I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future . __eou__ I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . __eou__ Fine . Thank you very much . __eou__
Would you like me to type it for you ? __eou__ Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? __eou__ Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Shall I right out again first ? __eou__ No , there ’ s no need . __eou__ Can I print it ? __eou__ No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . __eou__
Welcome to our factory . My name is Tiang Had and I'll show you around here.First we'll take a look at the workshop which produces food thermometers . Please , this way . __eou__ Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ? __eou__ Yes , it has . __eou__ Excuse me , what is this ? __eou__ This is a circuit board . __eou__ Are the batteries in it made by your people ? __eou__ No , they are from other factories . __eou__ What kind of battery is it ? __eou__ It is lithium which can be used for over three years . __eou__
Are you from America ? __eou__ No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . Nice to meet you ! __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around . __eou__ Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ? __eou__ About two years , but it seems as if I got here yesterday . __eou__
How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? __eou__ We try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__ What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? __eou__ We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__ But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__ Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill __eou__
Hello , thank you for calling Bradford and Sons . This is Tracy speaking , How may I help you ? __eou__ Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please . __eou__ Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk.May I tell her who is calling ? __eou__ This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Burton.Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ? __eou__
Hello , ABC company . __eou__ Hello , this is Mr . Morris Pitt . I'd like to speak to Mr . Bell , please . __eou__ Just a moment . I am sorry . At the moment , he is out of the office . Would you like to leave your number ? When he comes back , I will tell him to call you back . __eou__ Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number . __eou__ Of course . __eou__
Kenvir ? Hi , it's Alice . I'm very sorry that I have a big favor to ask you again . __eou__ How big , Alice ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 4 nights . __eou__ Well , I've got a huge load of typing and Mr . Brown has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . Could you help me to type half of it ? __eou__ All right , Alice . But this is the last time . I also have a lot of work to do . __eou__ Thank you , Kenvir . You're so kind . __eou__
The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made . __eou__ Is there anything special they would like to do ? __eou__ They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . __eou__ That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ? __eou__ They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . __eou__ I will set it up . __eou__ They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . __eou__
I had a job interview this morning . __eou__ Really ? How did it go ? __eou__ Pretty well , I think . __eou__
Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? __eou__ What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__ Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__ Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__ A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . __eou__
Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? __eou__ I'm sorry , he's out at the moment . __eou__ When do you expect him back ? __eou__ I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . __eou__ Well , may I leave a message ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? __eou__ Ok . Does he know your number ? __eou__ I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . __eou__ 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . __eou__ That's nice . __eou__ We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . __eou__ Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . __eou__
Good morning . Wilson Association . __eou__ This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please . __eou__ I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . __eou__ That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . __eou__ Is there anywhere I can reach him ? __eou__ I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ? __eou__ I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . __eou__ Would you care to make another appointment ? __eou__ Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . __eou__ I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Bye-bye . __eou__
Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ Do you play any sports or games ? __eou__ I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . __eou__ And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? __eou__ I was a runner-a long-distance runner . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . __eou__ Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ Let's give it a shot ! __eou__
I have applied for a transfer . __eou__ Really ? Do you mean that you are leaving ? __eou__ Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office . __eou__ I will miss you . But anyway I wish you every success at your new post . __eou__ Thanks . It's been a pleasure working with you . __eou__
I haven't got enough for prosecuting him . __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . __eou__ I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? __eou__ Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . __eou__ Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . __eou__
To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? __eou__ First of all , as far as I know , your company has had impressive records in business . Second , I want to enter the foreign trade field . __eou__ What was your chief responsibility in your past work ? __eou__ I am in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . __eou__
Susan , can you give me a hand ? __eou__ Sure , what's wrong ? __eou__ I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . __eou__ It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password . __eou__ What do I do after I've typed in my password ? __eou__ Just press ENTER and you've done . __eou__
Why did you choose Applied Sociology as your major ? __eou__ I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man . Hence , I chose it as my major . __eou__ Have you taken the course in Public Relations when you are in college ? __eou__ I am sorry to say I haven't , but I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR , such as Social Psychology , Public Affairs and Mass Communication . __eou__
Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? __eou__ Yes , I have found three companies . __eou__ Have you called to inquire about the positions ? __eou__ Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . __eou__ It's frustrating ! __eou__ The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . __eou__ Wonder why they do that ! __eou__ I feel terrible now . __eou__ Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually . __eou__ Thanks for your support and care . __eou__
Jason Emory speaking . __eou__ Hi , Jason . It ’ s Elizabeth Montgomery . Have you got those plans drawn up yet ? __eou__ Yeah . They were just sent over to your office . You should have them in about half an hour . __eou__ Thanks a lot . Sorry to trouble you . __eou__
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ No , really ? __eou__ Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ Who will be there ? __eou__ James is going to be packed off there . __eou__ That is good . He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
Are you introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . __eou__ What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . __eou__
Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? __eou__ He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . __eou__ I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . __eou__ I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . __eou__ Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . __eou__ It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . __eou__ Whatever we said , we must be more careful . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . __eou__
I need help with the office party . __eou__ Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ? __eou__ I have no idea what the entertainment should be . __eou__ Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ? __eou__ Let's make it a formal affair . __eou__ Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ? __eou__ American food would be the best choice . __eou__ That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ? __eou__ We should bring in a really good DJ . __eou__ That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ? __eou__ Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . __eou__ I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? __eou__ Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . __eou__ Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . __eou__ But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . __eou__ I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . __eou__ Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? __eou__ Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . __eou__
I'm Mary Kell . May I ask your name ? __eou__ My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? __eou__ I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__ Thank you . Miss Kelly . __eou__ What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? __eou__ I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . __eou__ Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? __eou__ Yes , I would . ( After testing ) __eou__ Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__ All right .

Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__ I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__ Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__ No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__ I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! __eou__
Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson . __eou__ I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? __eou__ I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies . __eou__ Have you got any selling experience at all ? __eou__ I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation . __eou__ Now tell me about your educational background . __eou__ I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration . __eou__ What courses have you completed ? __eou__ The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology . __eou__ What subjects did you like most at university ? __eou__ I liked sales strategies most . __eou__ Why would you like to work with us ? __eou__ It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . __eou__ What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? __eou__ I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing . __eou__ Good . Do you know anything about this company ? __eou__ Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products . __eou__ Have you got anything to ask me ? __eou__ Will traveling be required in this position ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How often ? __eou__ Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__
Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? __eou__ Sure , what's the matter ? __eou__ As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . __eou__ What do you think we can do about this ? __eou__ We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . __eou__ Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . __eou__ I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__ OK ! I will try this . __eou__
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__ Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... __eou__
Who will meet you at the airport ? __eou__ No one . __eou__ Oh , then I will arrange one of my staff to meet you at the airport . __eou__
Could you give us a detailed description of the properties of your product ? __eou__ OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office . __eou__ Could you tell me more about it ? __eou__ Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned . __eou__ Can you introduce its price level to me ? __eou__ We have this item in three price level . __eou__ We need the best possible quality . __eou__ That means this one . __eou__ I see , that's what I will order . __eou__
I don't make idle threats . __eou__ I guess not . __eou__ I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . __eou__ Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . __eou__ If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . __eou__ What are you trying to say ? __eou__ I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? __eou__
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__ Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__ Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__ That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__ We must find some time to read report . __eou__ I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__ See you . __eou__
What salary are you expecting ? __eou__ What range of salary do you have for this position ? __eou__ It can be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 a year depending on experience and qualifications . __eou__ It sounds amazing to me . __eou__

And I ’ m patient . __eou__ what kind of people do you like to work with ? __eou__ I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people . __eou__ what ’ s your greatest strength ? __eou__ well , this is a challenging question . I suppose I would say that I ’ m a quick learner . __eou__ so , you ’ re smart . __eou__ I think so . I think that I am good at what I do . __eou__ what do you consider your weakness ? __eou__ I ’ m not good at speaking in public . I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public . __eou__ that ’ s not a problem . It ’ s unnecessary for this position . __eou__
We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out .

I work very hard . __eou__ Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__ Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__ It's unfair . __eou__ We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__ OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__ All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . __eou__

My educational background and professional experience make me qualified for the job . __eou__ Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ Oh , just one thing , could you give me some ideas of the pay ? __eou__ What salary do you get for your present position ? __eou__ 2,000 RIB per month . __eou__ What starting salary would you expect here ? __eou__ 3,000 RIB per month . __eou__ No problem , we pay 3,000 RIB per month .

It's usually very reliable . __eou__ What's actually wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . __eou__ I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . __eou__

Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ?

All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research .

The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . __eou__ I am afraid I can't agree with you there .

You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . __eou__ I agree that yours are of the top . __eou__ Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . __eou__ Impossible .

Your definition on success ? __eou__ Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything .

It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__ What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__ Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week .

But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__ How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__ Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . __eou__ How would your present boss describe you ? __eou__ He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__ What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__ They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . __eou__
Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ? __eou__ Yes , I have received an Engineers Qualification Certificate and a drivers license . __eou__ How many years have you had the drivers license ? __eou__ I have two years driving experience . __eou__ That ’ s good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? __eou__ I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . __eou__ What computer languages have you learned ? __eou__ Visual C + + , C and Delphi . __eou__ Have you gotten any special training in programming ? __eou__ No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . __eou__

I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__ I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__ Well , I guess so . __eou__
Why have you decided to change jobs ? __eou__ I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field.Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__ Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__ Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__ It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . __eou__ I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__ Do you mind going on frequent business traps ? __eou__ No , I enjoy travelling . __eou__

I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? __eou__ Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__ From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft .

I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__

How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? __eou__ I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in .

It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . __eou__ It will be expensive to do outside the campus .

They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . __eou__ Good thinking !

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__

What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . __eou__

Your firm is a young organization with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . __eou__ Well , I think our interview is complete then . We will give you a call in ten days or so . __eou__ Thank you , Mr .

But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . __eou__ He's the only one of the several to decide this . __eou__ How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . __eou__ I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . __eou__ But I lost the chance . __eou__ Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday . __eou__
One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__ I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
You look tired . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ Really ? How come ? __eou__ My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning .

I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . __eou__ Just what are you proposing ? __eou__ We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . __eou__ That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? __eou__ I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__ Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__ Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__ I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__ I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__ Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__ Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . __eou__
Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? __eou__ I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . __eou__ Fine . At 3:30 ? __eou__

Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__ After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__ I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__ The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__ It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__ 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__ Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__ We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . __eou__ Is there probation ? __eou__ No probation is involved .

I believe he is in London . __eou__ Ok , home or office address ? __eou__ Office address , please .

Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . __eou__ Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . __eou__ Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . __eou__ Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . __eou__ I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . __eou__ Good luck to us . __eou__
I want to offer you more invoking stock options . __eou__ When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? __eou__ Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . __eou__ I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . __eou__ Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? __eou__ Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . __eou__ Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? __eou__ This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . __eou__ And what is it regarding please ? __eou__ We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling . __eou__ Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . __eou__
How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ? __eou__ Easy . View the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . Many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting . __eou__ Which websites are most popular ? __eou__ 21st Talent Website , 51 Job , and Zhaopin.com are most popular . __eou__
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__ Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__ Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__ Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__ What did that involve ? __eou__ Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__ I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , okay . __eou__
Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ’ s on your mind ? __eou__ Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty . __eou__ Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours . __eou__ OK , I completely understand . __eou__
Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office . __eou__ Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . __eou__ Ok , see you then , bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . __eou__ That's great . You need to prepare for it . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Buy an expensive suit . __eou__ Is a white shirt OK ? __eou__ Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . __eou__
You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? __eou__ Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . __eou__ That's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__ Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__ Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? __eou__ Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . __eou__ Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__ Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . __eou__
How is your English ability ? __eou__ Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__ English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position , especially in the starting period . What ’ s your ability in these two fields ? __eou__ I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . __eou__ What else do you have to prove your English ability ? __eou__ I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm . When I get them involved with something constructive , some of them change their attitude later . __eou__ Yes , I see . __eou__
Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? __eou__ Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__ Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? __eou__ It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__ The accounts department , I think . __eou__ The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . __eou__
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right . __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ Yes . You should rent a brown suit and a black shirt . __eou__ May I try this on ? __eou__ Yes . Let me help you . __eou__
Are you Miss Thou Ping ? __eou__ Yes . I am Thou Ping . __eou__ How do you spell you first name ? __eou__ Ping . P-I-N-G . __eou__ Do you have an English name ? __eou__ Yes , sir . It is Jane . It was given by my English professor when I was at the university . __eou__ What ’ s your pen name ? __eou__ My pen name is ' Dark Blue ' . __eou__ How do you like your name ? __eou__ I like it very much . My name has became part of me . I don ’ t want to change it . __eou__ What ’ s your present ( permanent ) address ? __eou__ My present address is No . 21 South Zhongshan Road , Apt . 19 , Shanghai . The post code is 220150 . __eou__ You look very young . How old are you ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m thirty now . __eou__ Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Xinjiang . __eou__ What is your nationality ? __eou__ Han . __eou__
Please switch work shifts with me . __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Why can't you ? __eou__ Because I have other obligations . __eou__
What do you think of our price ? __eou__ Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . __eou__ I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes , this is the best we can do . __eou__ I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . __eou__
I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . __eou__ It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__ What about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__ All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__ A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__ Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__ I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? __eou__ I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__ What is our time frame ? __eou__ Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . __eou__
What made you decide on this type of occupation ? __eou__ Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . __eou__ Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? __eou__ Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . __eou__ Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? __eou__ The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . __eou__ Are you in good health ? __eou__ I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . __eou__ Have you had any nursing experience ? __eou__ Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . __eou__ How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? __eou__ My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . __eou__ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . __eou__ If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? __eou__ I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . __eou__
How often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__ Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__ What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ Unless they're united , very little ... __eou__
This is Dunlin . Is this Mrs Smith speaking ? __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I just want to call and say thank you for letting me interview yesterday . __eou__ You are welcome , Mr . Sun . __eou__ And I also want to know what the status is of the position . __eou__ Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it . __eou__ Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye . __eou__ Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye . __eou__
Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . __eou__ Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__ Do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__ Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . __eou__ Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? __eou__ I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ? __eou__ It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? __eou__
Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . __eou__ Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__ I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__ Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__ You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
What are the requirements to apply for the position ? __eou__ Your major must be computer . __eou__ Do you think my educational background suits this position ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . __eou__ Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? __eou__ Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . __eou__ Could you tell something about the job ? __eou__ Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . __eou__ Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . __eou__
Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . __eou__ Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? __eou__ Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__ Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? __eou__ Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... __eou__ Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? __eou__ You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . __eou__
Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you .

Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager . __eou__ Great – That ’ ll be big help . __eou__

I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__ That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? __eou__ Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? __eou__ All right I'll read it soon . __eou__ Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__ Oh . It's nothing Navy . __eou__

I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__ Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__ Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__ You've earned it . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__

On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__ Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__ All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation .

Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . __eou__ It's OK . __eou__ What did you do in the interview ? __eou__ I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . __eou__ Are all these helpful for the interview ? __eou__ Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . __eou__
What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__ What is your problem in working ? __eou__ I am too introverted to let others become my friends . __eou__
Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__ Yes , sir .

Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . __eou__ They are popular in and out of our department .

The language used in this multinational company is mainly about English ; do you think you can manage to handle that ? __eou__ Yes . I am sure I can .

John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment .

Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__ How about sick days ? __eou__ You get five paid sick days . __eou__ Any other benefits ? __eou__ Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__ Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__ We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? __eou__ Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? __eou__ My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . __eou__ Did you work at all during the last pay period ? __eou__ Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . __eou__ Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? __eou__ Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__ Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . __eou__ Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . __eou__ That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . __eou__
Which school are you attending ? __eou__ I am attending Hebes University of Technology . __eou__ When will you graduate from that university ? __eou__ This coming July . __eou__ What degree will you receive ? __eou__ I will receive a Bachelor's degree . __eou__ What is your major ? __eou__ My major is Business Administration . __eou__ How have you been getting on with your studies so far ? __eou__ I have been doing quite well at college . According to the academic records I've achieved so far , I am confident that I will get my Bachelor of Business Administration this coming July . __eou__ How do you think the education you've received will contribute to your work in this institution ? __eou__ I have already learned a lot in the classroom and I hope to be able to make practical use of it in your company . My specialization at the university is just in line with the areas your institute deals with . I am sure I can apply what I have learned to the work in your institute . __eou__
Rachel ? I ’ m not sure how you want to handle this account . I think there are a few things to be sorted out . __eou__ I agree , Toni .

But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . __eou__ Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No , I was way too busy studying all the time .

Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? __eou__ My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . __eou__ What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? __eou__ First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . __eou__
Carla , I know you ’ re kind of new in this business and I want to give you some advice . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Michael ? __eou__ You have to listen to what the client asks for .

He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me .

We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__ Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__ The offices there were too expensive .

They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . __eou__
Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . __eou__ More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__ Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? __eou__ It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . __eou__

You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . __eou__ Then what else should I put into my resume ? __eou__ Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? __eou__ I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? __eou__ Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . __eou__ I see . Is that all there is to it ? __eou__ No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . __eou__ Oh , good point .

However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__ Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__ It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . __eou__
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . __eou__ Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . __eou__ To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . __eou__ Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . __eou__ Excellent . Have you had French food before ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Marvelous ! __eou__
I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ? __eou__ Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? __eou__ That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 __eou__ That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel . __eou__
I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? __eou__ It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . __eou__
Hello . I am calling to apply for the job as an airlines staff . I'd like to check it . Is it part-time or a full-time job ? __eou__ OK , the job is a full-time one . __eou__ What does the job description say ? __eou__ We need a person with ability and flexibility . __eou__
Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . __eou__ Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? __eou__ Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? __eou__ Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! __eou__ That's fine . See you then . __eou__
We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ The material was not damaged by us . __eou__ We'll have to talk this over some more . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . __eou__
Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? __eou__ I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . __eou__ You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . __eou__ Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? __eou__ I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . __eou__ All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? __eou__ Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . __eou__ Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? __eou__ Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . __eou__ Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . __eou__
Are you paid on a commission or salary basis now ? __eou__ I'm paid on a salary . __eou__ What's your monthly salary ? __eou__ At present I get 1,800 yuan per month . __eou__ How much do you hope to get a month here ? __eou__ That's not the problem I care about . You can decide on my capacity and experience . __eou__ If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Brown . I really appreciate your assistance . __eou__
Hello , Westhaven Company . __eou__ Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ? __eou__ This is Michael Richard speaking . Who is calling ? __eou__ Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday . __eou__ You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position . __eou__ We have made the decision to hire you . __eou__ Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . __eou__ I will , thank you for calling . __eou__
I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? __eou__ I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? __eou__ I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . __eou__ Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . __eou__ I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . __eou__ So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . __eou__ Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . __eou__ You are very nice to tell me those . __eou__ I wish you good luck ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
How do you choose which companies to work with ? __eou__ Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . __eou__
Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . __eou__ Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? __eou__ I'm afraid ... __eou__ All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . __eou__
Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? __eou__ What ’ s this form for ? __eou__ This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . __eou__ That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . __eou__ Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? __eou__ Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . __eou__ Then , what do you think I should do ? __eou__ My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . __eou__ I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . __eou__ Keep in touch . __eou__
We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? __eou__ Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . __eou__ I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . __eou__ What about the cost of delivery ? __eou__ We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B . __eou__
We ’ re going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays . Let ’ s make a list . __eou__ Fine , Mr . Richardson . What do you have in mind ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter . __eou__ Yes ! I agree ! We could really use another one ! I ’ ll get on that right away ! What else would you like to order ? __eou__
What are your personal weaknesses ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . __eou__ Are you more of a leader or a follower ? __eou__ I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? __eou__ Yes , in most circumstances . __eou__ Are you available for travel ? __eou__ Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently . __eou__
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__ For the construction site manager ? __eou__ That's the one . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ You were right . It was from a headhunter . She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract . __eou__ Well , no surprise there . __eou__ No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . __eou__ Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ I'm going there tomorrow . __eou__ Great . Good luck . __eou__
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__ They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . __eou__
Is that a no-smoking sign ? __eou__ Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . __eou__ What does that sign mean ? __eou__ It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them . __eou__
We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . __eou__ Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . __eou__ Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . __eou__ We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . __eou__ I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . __eou__ We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . __eou__ OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . __eou__
Did you hear something ? __eou__ Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Steven , what's your idea of price ? __eou__ The best we can do is $ 120 per case . __eou__ I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . __eou__ I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . __eou__ Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . __eou__ It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? __eou__ Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Take your time , please . __eou__
The client you're meeting tomorrow likes to ask a lot of questions , so you have to be well prepared . __eou__ I see . __eou__
We're going to have to postpone the meeting . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr . Chen can't make it today . __eou__
Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? __eou__ Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . __eou__ The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? __eou__ Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . __eou__ That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? __eou__ No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . __eou__
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . __eou__
How was your flight from Hong Kong ? __eou__ Okay . What time is the meeting tomorrow ? __eou__ 10:30 . I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10:00 . : 10:30 . __eou__
I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . __eou__ That ’ ll be most helpful . __eou__ That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . __eou__ How much do you spend on development every year ? __eou__ About 3-4 % of the gross sales . __eou__ What ’ s that building opposite us ? __eou__ That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . __eou__ If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? __eou__ It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . __eou__
I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ? __eou__ Yes.Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I've got a meeting from nine to ten.What about Monday afternoon ? __eou__ I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ? __eou__
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__ Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__ Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
What's your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical nine to five job . Actually , I work a little longer than nine to five most days . __eou__ Do you get paid overtime ? __eou__ No , I don't . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? __eou__ There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . __eou__
Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think __eou__ I agree . __eou__ Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? __eou__ I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? __eou__ Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . __eou__ Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? __eou__ Shoot ! __eou__ Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? __eou__ I don't see a problem . __eou__ Good ! Do you have any questions ? __eou__
When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? __eou__ It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms . Barkley . __eou__ That shouldn ’ t be a problem . What is the exact address , again ? __eou__ 7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 . __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__ You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__ You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__
How many kinds of secretaries work here ? __eou__ There are 3 secretarial categories here . One is receptionist , one is junior secretary , and the other is senior secretary . __eou__ What sort of duties do you expect ? __eou__ I would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs . __eou__
How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits ? __eou__ Are you working fewer hours than you used to work ? __eou__ I got laid off . __eou__ You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours . __eou__ Do all jobs provide unemployment ? __eou__ Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t . __eou__ Do you think that my job pays unemployment ? __eou__ You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you . __eou__ Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment ? __eou__ There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned . They will let you know when you file your claim . __eou__
Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? __eou__ Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__ I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__ Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__ It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
Yes , Mr . Emory ? __eou__ I need the number for John Reese ’ s office . __eou__ Just one moment , sir . Here you are – 767-4512 . __eou__
What did you do at the office today ? __eou__ I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the __eou__ I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__ I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required __eou__ It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__ I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ You certainly had a busy day . __eou__ That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . __eou__
I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods . __eou__ Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? __eou__ I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . __eou__ My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? __eou__ Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? __eou__ What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . __eou__ But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__ It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . __eou__ Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . __eou__
May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ? __eou__ Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9 __eou__ Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Thank you very much . __eou__ You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB __eou__
What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . __eou__ It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . __eou__ Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . __eou__ Why ? This is a fair market price . __eou__ It certainly is . __eou__ Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . __eou__ I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . __eou__ We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . __eou__ That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . __eou__ But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . __eou__ I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . __eou__
How much are you asking for this ? __eou__ I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ? __eou__ Is tax already included in their price ? __eou__ Yes . Our price can't be matched . __eou__ Would you consider a volume discount ? __eou__ If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount . __eou__ I'll accept your offer . __eou__
In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . __eou__ How to adjust ? __eou__ Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . __eou__ Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . __eou__ That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . __eou__ Yes , sometimes the differences are great . __eou__ Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . __eou__ We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . __eou__
Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ? __eou__ Yes , I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license . __eou__ How many years have you had the driver's license ? __eou__ I have two years driving experience . __eou__ That's good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? __eou__ I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . __eou__ What computer languages have you learned ? __eou__ Visual C + + , C and Delphi . __eou__ Have you gotten any special training in programming ? __eou__ No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . __eou__
I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit . __eou__ I'm very sorry to hear that . __eou__ Please handle future shipments with more care . __eou__ We'll take great care . __eou__
Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . If you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__ How about sick days ? __eou__ You get 5 paid sick days . __eou__ Any other benefits ? __eou__ Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__ Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__ We'll contact you soon , Tom . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
Can you read and write English and French ? __eou__ No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . __eou__ Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__ My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university . __eou__
Have you had any experience with sales work ? __eou__ Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . __eou__ What exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__ Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__ Did you like your work ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ But when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__ I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__ I see . Why did you choose our company ? __eou__ I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . __eou__
I've got some great news for you ! __eou__ Did you get the position you wanted ? __eou__ Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__ Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . __eou__ It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . __eou__ You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . __eou__ The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background .

Where do you see yourself three years from now ? __eou__ Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm ! __eou__ Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? __eou__ Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . __eou__ Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? __eou__ Well , a working relationship . I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important . But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss . __eou__

I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . __eou__ Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? __eou__ No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . __eou__ He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . __eou__ We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . __eou__ I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . __eou__ That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . __eou__
do you have a minute ? __eou__ sure , what would you like to discuss ? __eou__ I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . __eou__ well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . __eou__ can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__ oh , no . not at all . __eou__ are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ no , sir . __eou__ have you been given a better offer ? __eou__ Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . __eou__ well , what's the problem then ? __eou__ it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__ really ? I didn't know that would be possible . __eou__ sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__ thanks , sir . __eou__
Mr . Simpson , if you are free , how about a lunch ? __eou__ When do you have in mind ? __eou__ How about Thursday ? __eou__ That will be fine with me . __eou__ I know of a place you'll like and you have got to be there . __eou__ Good . I'll be there at 12:30 . __eou__ OK , see you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__

Is that right ? __eou__ No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . __eou__ Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? __eou__ Yes.That ' s true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . __eou__ It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . __eou__
Hi , Jeny.Are still working ? __eou__ Hi , Nacy.Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . __eou__ So , you are leaving , aren't you ? __eou__ yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . __eou__ How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__ That's all right . I'm almost finished.Do you need my help ? __eou__ Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? __eou__ Oh . all right I'll read it soon . __eou__ Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__ It's nothing Navy . __eou__

Did you hear something ? __eou__ Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Could you cover for me on Tuesday ? I'm not coming back until Wednesday . __eou__ Sure . What ’ s up ? __eou__ We're going to the beach for the weekend . __eou__ Are you going fishing ? __eou__ No .

Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . __eou__ Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__ Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__ Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__ Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms .

We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__ Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__ Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . __eou__ Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " .

Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? __eou__ 15 dollars per dozen __eou__ Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . __eou__ However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . __eou__ If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__ I hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__ We'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__ What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__ Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? __eou__ About 300 dozens . __eou__ Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . __eou__ OK . That's a deal . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ Yes , except the personal mail .

We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . __eou__ I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__ You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__ I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__ Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__ And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__ That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__ So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__ Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__ I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__ Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__ I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__ I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__ Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__ Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__ Agreed . __eou__ For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__ I understand your position . __eou__
Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Charles , the manager , please . __eou__ You don't make any prior appointment , do you ? __eou__ No .

My name is Lin Tao , the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation . __eou__ I see . Wait a minute , please . __eou__ ( 2 minutes later ) Mr . Lin , Mr . Charles can see you now . This way , please . __eou__
Welcome to China , Mr . Smith . __eou__ Thank you .

I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . __eou__ That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . __eou__ What's the proposal ? __eou__ Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? __eou__ Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . __eou__ Sounds like we have the same idea . __eou__

So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ?

You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__ There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__ How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__ Ok . I can settle for that . __eou__

What characteristics should an interpreter own ? __eou__ I think he should be an expert of everything . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language .

How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__ Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? __eou__ Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__ Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__ As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time . __eou__ I'm afraid I won't be free next week . __eou__ It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__
We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? __eou__ As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
What kind of job do you intend to do ? __eou__ I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . __eou__ What are your plans if you were hired ? __eou__ I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . __eou__

I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__ What is your weakness ? __eou__ I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . __eou__ What is your greatest accomplishment ? __eou__ I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . __eou__ Can you work under pressure ? __eou__ Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . __eou__ What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ? __eou__ There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . __eou__
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__ I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__ I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? __eou__ Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . __eou__ I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? __eou__ If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . __eou__ But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? __eou__ The note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval . __eou__ OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? __eou__ No . We still enjoy 10 - day of paid vacation per year . __eou__ Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? __eou__ Of course . That's what we deserve . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ I have something else to remind you of . Don't be late , if you are late , you will be fined 20 Yuan per minute . __eou__ Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . __eou__ So remember to set your alarm clock . __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . Li . I have something to discuss with you . __eou__ I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ? __eou__ I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It's about the overtime you've asked me to put in . __eou__ All right . What's the problem ? __eou__ I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Take good care of your husband . I'll find another one to replace you . __eou__
Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking . __eou__ Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ? __eou__ No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 . __eou__
Do you have some questions ? __eou__ Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . __eou__ If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . __eou__ I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . __eou__ Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__
Welcome to our company . __eou__ I really love this kind of atmosphere . __eou__ An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . __eou__ There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ? __eou__ She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . __eou__ And what about that man there ? __eou__ He is our accountant . __eou__ I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . __eou__ Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . __eou__
Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__

It's no problem for me to travel frequently . __eou__ OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test . __eou__ Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy . May I speak to Mr . Smith ? __eou__ Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ? __eou__ I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith . __eou__ Oh , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ I've got a fever and a very sore throat . __eou__ Well , you sound ill over the phone . __eou__ Yes .

During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? __eou__ Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? __eou__ I did clerical stuff and ran errands . __eou__ In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary . __eou__ May I know about the office hours ? __eou__ Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ? __eou__ We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise . __eou__ When will I know your decision ? __eou__ I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . __eou__ All right . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__ Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__ Great idea . __eou__ Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . __eou__ Let it be ! Time will tell . __eou__ Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . __eou__
I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? __eou__ Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . __eou__ All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ? __eou__ I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
How's your job search going ? __eou__ I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__ yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__ that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__ absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__ good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__ a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__ no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__ sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__ yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__ got it . I'll start right now . __eou__
How can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited . I would like to see Mr . Smith . __eou__ Do you have an appointment ? __eou__ Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . __eou__ I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p . m . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly .

This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__ I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__ If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . __eou__ Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . __eou__ Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__ No . __eou__ That's strange . __eou__ Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__ Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__ I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__ I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__ They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__ Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__ For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__ Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__ I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__ When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__ Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__ Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__ No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__ Maybe . I will look around . __eou__

Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? __eou__ Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__ I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__ Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__ I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . __eou__
What's your expected salary ? __eou__ I expect to be paid according to my abilities . __eou__ How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus . __eou__ That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . __eou__ That sounds very reasonable . __eou__ By the way , how long is my probation ? __eou__ Generally it is 6 months and during this period you are half-paid . __eou__
Are you a goal-oriented person ? __eou__ Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . __eou__ How do you plan to do your present job ? __eou__ I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . __eou__
Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . __eou__ I'm on my way . __eou__
So how was your interview ? __eou__ I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__ Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . __eou__ Thanks , I'll keep that in mind . __eou__

Then what did you do ? __eou__ When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes .

What position have you held before ? __eou__ I have been a salesman . __eou__ Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? __eou__ I am in charge of the trading department . __eou__ What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__ I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . __eou__ Why do you leave your present company ? __eou__ I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . __eou__ Why did you pick this organization ? __eou__ I'm very much interested in the position . __eou__ What made you decide to join our company ? __eou__ I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . __eou__
You look tired . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ Really ? How come ? __eou__ My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! __eou__ You shouldn ’ t work so hard . __eou__ I know . But hard work pays off , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . __eou__

Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . __eou__ Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__ Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__
Sandy , can you help me contact these people ? __eou__ Sure , what do you want me to tell them ? __eou__ Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes . __eou__ Ok , where can I find their telephone number ? __eou__ They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . __eou__ Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? __eou__ Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . __eou__ Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? __eou__ Then , you should e-mail them with the information . __eou__ Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? __eou__ They should have then listed on their resumes . __eou__ And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? __eou__ Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . __eou__ Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? __eou__ Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . __eou__ Did you leave a voice message ? __eou__ I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . __eou__ I see . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that she should call me back at my office number . __eou__ Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . __eou__ Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . __eou__ One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? __eou__ Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . __eou__ Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__ Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? __eou__ hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__ so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__ so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__ one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__ I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__ that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__ may I make a suggestion ? __eou__ sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__ Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__ I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . __eou__
After I am accepted for unemployment benefits , what will happen next ? __eou__ You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter . __eou__ What will that tell me ? __eou__ The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly . __eou__ Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ? __eou__ You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks . __eou__ What information will I need to provide on that form ? __eou__ They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made . __eou__ Are there any other questions on the form ? __eou__ Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick . __eou__

I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ?

I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha __eou__ let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living !

That will save you plenty of money . __eou__ that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__ if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__
My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts .

Besides , they also get chances of free traveling . __eou__ That's quite good . Thank you for telling me about those . __eou__

I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . __eou__ So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . __eou__ I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . __eou__ You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . __eou__ That sounds reasonable . __eou__ Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . __eou__ That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . __eou__ Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . __eou__

Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ?

Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ We should be able to finish everything up before then .

Do you have any job placement services at EDD ? __eou__ The first thing that you should check out is callous , which is a great Internet-based placement service that you can use . __eou__ What about people who don ’ t have a computer ? __eou__ You can search for jobs on the computers at the EDD offices . __eou__ What else is there at the EDD offices that can help me with my job search ? __eou__ We can help you find local information about available jobs and workshops . __eou__ What are the different workshops that are available at the EDD offices ? __eou__ Resume Writing and Interviewing are our two most popular workshops . __eou__ Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ? __eou__ Many times there are special services available to certain groups like Women at Work or job help for non-English speakers . __eou__

If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . __eou__ Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__ Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__ Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . __eou__
I've just taken a spanner set from the stores . __eou__ That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory . __eou__ Sorry , what do you mean ? __eou__ When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder . __eou__
OK ! Let's get down to business now . __eou__ Say it . __eou__ As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__ That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__ I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__ Could you put it in detail ? __eou__ Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . __eou__ I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__ What kind of media do you recommend ? __eou__ I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . __eou__ Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__ I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . __eou__
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__ First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__ I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ? __eou__ Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__ Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__ The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__ Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__ When will the branch office open ? __eou__ Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__ Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__ Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine . __eou__ I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . __eou__
