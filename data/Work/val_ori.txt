We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__

Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions .

But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her .

Please write them down on the notice board . I want everybody to see them . __eou__ OK . __eou__
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__ Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown . __eou__ How do you do ? I'm Mary Green . __eou__ Sorry , what was your last name again ? __eou__ Green , G-R-E-E-N , but just call me Mary . __eou__ OK . I'm Dick . __eou__ Glad to meet you . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Yes , please . I ’ m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested . __eou__ Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ What was your major in school ? __eou__ I majored in Public Relations . __eou__ Have you done any work in this field ? __eou__ Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year . __eou__ What section did you work in ? __eou__ The export Business Section . __eou__ So you must be very familiar with export procedures . __eou__ Yes , very much . __eou__ That's good . __eou__
Name and examination number , please . __eou__ My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . __eou__ What part of the country do you come from ? __eou__ I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China . __eou__ Do you have a big family at your hometown ? __eou__ Not very big . There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ No . I'm still single . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! __eou__
Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our firm to take into consideration ? __eou__ Yes . My house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? __eou__ No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room . __eou__ That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? __eou__ You ’ ll get bonuses at the end of each year according to your achievements . Besides , we offer you 1 % commission on all your sales . __eou__ Oh , just one more thing , could you give me some idea about holidays ? __eou__ You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . In addition , you may have a paid month vacation every year . But when it is necessary , we do expect you to work overtime . Does it suit you ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? __eou__ I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . __eou__ I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? __eou__ Sure , please hold on . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . __eou__ You are so kind , you helped me a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . Bye ! __eou__

Excuse me sir . May I come in ? __eou__ Mike , you're late again . __eou__ I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__ Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__ But it's true . __eou__ How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__ That's coincident 。 __eou__ Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__ I promise I will . __eou__ You'd better . __eou__
What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? __eou__ Cartons . Is that okay ? __eou__ I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__ Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__ In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__ Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__ You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__ We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__ It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__ Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . __eou__

I graduated this past June . __eou__ Which university did you graduate from ? __eou__ Guangzhou University . __eou__ What degree did you receive ? __eou__ I received a bachelor's degree in Economics . __eou__ What courses did you take in college ? __eou__ My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English __eou__ Why did you choose to study Economics ? __eou__ Because I was quite interested in Economics then . __eou__ Can you speak other languages except English ? __eou__ I can also speak a little Japanese . __eou__ I am very satisfied with your answers . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . __eou__ Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__ Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__ Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen . __eou__ Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? __eou__ Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . __eou__ Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__ Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__ I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__

Have any trouble finding the place ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ So why don ’ t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ? __eou__ Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy . __eou__ What would you consider your strengths ? __eou__ I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes . __eou__ What is your biggest weakness ? __eou__ I tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged . __eou__ We have a position where that could work out well . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__ Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__ Well , I missed several buses . __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__ I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__ Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__ Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__ Have you got it now ? __eou__ Yes , I found it again . __eou__ When ? __eou__ This morning . I mean ... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation . __eou__
Hello , are you Muriel Douglas ? __eou__ Yes , and you must be James . It's nice to meet you at long last . __eou__ Yes , you too . Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account . My associate , Susan Kim , should be here any minute . Would you like something to drink while we're waiting ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm fine . Did you have a nice holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I did .

We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day . __eou__ How did you like it ? __eou__ It was better than I expected . But , you know , I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better . Do you go there often ? __eou__ No , not much . My wife doesn't like to ski . She prefers vacationing where it's warmer , like Hawaii . __eou__ I don't blame her . I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago . I'd like to go back sometime soon . __eou__ Yes , me too . Oh , here's Susan now . Let me introduce you . __eou__

Do you believe that classified ads in the newspaper are the most effective way to search for a job ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . I think the Internet would be better . __eou__ OK , but I am going to look at the want ads in this newspaper first . __eou__ well , there is no doubt that many people have found jobs through the want ads in the newspaper . __eou__

Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to finish this report first . __eou__ Never mind . I'll do it . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__

I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006 . __eou__ Do you have any publications ? __eou__ Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily . __eou__
Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation . __eou__ I'm very delighted too . I'm sure that we'll have a wider range of cooperation . So , let's drink to the signing of our contract . __eou__ Bottoms up ! __eou__ Cheers . __eou__
Hello , is that John ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am calling to tell you some issues about the interview . __eou__ The volume is too loud . Would you kindly turn it down a little bit ? __eou__ Yes . I think it is now a moderate volume . __eou__
Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . __eou__ Like who ? __eou__ Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . __eou__ I've got it under control . __eou__ You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__ What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__ That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . __eou__
Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . __eou__ All right . Please read it to me . __eou__ On Friday morning , Mr .

Yang , vice manager of computer corporation . __eou__ Very good . __eou__ On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . __eou__ Oh , that's great . __eou__

White . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . __eou__ Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? __eou__ Yes , Sir . __eou__ These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__ All right , who should I send them to ? __eou__ It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . __eou__ Ok , home or office address ? __eou__ Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . __eou__ Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s right . __eou__
In foreign trade , language differences are very important . __eou__ Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . __eou__ Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . __eou__ Many exporters speak French and German as well . __eou__ In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . __eou__ Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . __eou__ Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . __eou__ Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . __eou__ So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . __eou__
Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? __eou__ Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . __eou__ Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . __eou__ Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . __eou__ You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? __eou__ Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__ I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__ The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__ Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . __eou__ Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . __eou__ Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? __eou__ Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . __eou__ But I am not familiar with the members of the board . __eou__ Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . __eou__ That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . __eou__
Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ? __eou__ Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule . __eou__ Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . __eou__
It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__ We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__ Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__
I was really glad to hear about your award , congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work . __eou__
What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? __eou__ It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . __eou__
Are you ready to move ? __eou__ Definitely . I Ve got the hell out of the company . Anything new ? __eou__ Yes , but there is a chance that might be suitable for you . __eou__ Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ? __eou__ I can't say , but let me make a call and see if I can help . __eou__ I appreciate the effort , sir . __eou__
I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? __eou__ Yes , I think so too . __eou__ Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . __eou__ I'm sorry we can't now . __eou__ I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . __eou__ Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . __eou__ That would work too . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? __eou__ I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . __eou__ I understand . Will the company provide training ? __eou__ Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . __eou__ That's great . Thank you very much . __eou__
How is your job search 1 going , Janet ? __eou__ I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . __eou__ Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__ I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted . __eou__ Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . __eou__

I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__ But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . __eou__ Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__ Ok .

Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__ If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__ We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__ We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__ I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__ I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . __eou__
I'm tired . __eou__ Okay , let's call it a day . __eou__
How do you get along with your boss ? __eou__ I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . __eou__ What do you think is important in your work ? __eou__ Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . __eou__

Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__ I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__ I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . __eou__
Do you have any experience working with a computer ? __eou__ Yes .

It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . __eou__
Let's get down to business . __eou__ OK . Have you seen the samples ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . __eou__ What's your price ? __eou__ 150 yuan for each piece . __eou__ That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay . __eou__ How about 130 yuan ? __eou__ I offer you 110 yuan . __eou__ That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan . __eou__ All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? __eou__ If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . __eou__ Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . __eou__ Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . __eou__
What ’ s up ? __eou__ I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? __eou__ Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__ Well , it has nothing to do with virus .

Why do you want to be a teacher ? __eou__ It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . __eou__ In what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? __eou__ I want to work in the English Department , as I am an English major . __eou__
What do you expect of the position ? __eou__ I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement . __eou__ What do you think about occupational planning ? __eou__ It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future . __eou__ Tell me something about your goals . __eou__ As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . __eou__ If confronted with difficult task , what will you do ? __eou__ I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time . __eou__ Would you care much about your salary ? __eou__ Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job . __eou__ If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ? __eou__ I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about . __eou__
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? __eou__ They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__ Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__ Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . __eou__ If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . __eou__ You're on . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . __eou__

Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . __eou__ Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . __eou__ Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . __eou__ Have you had any experience with computer ? __eou__ Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . __eou__ That's fine .

So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__ Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__ Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__

They say my English is quite good . __eou__ How many years have you been learning English ? __eou__ Oh , more than ten years .

Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? __eou__ Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . __eou__ That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps .

Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__ Of course , let me help you . __eou__ The color and style are consistent with the sample .
