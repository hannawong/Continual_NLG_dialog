I've got to go . __eou__
I ’ m sorry to disturb you , Mr . Crane . __eou__ Yes , what is it , William ? __eou__ Could you please look over these resumes ? They ’ Ve just come in . __eou__ All right , fine . Thank you , William . __eou__
Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . __eou__ Surely it is . __eou__ You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . __eou__ You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . __eou__ When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . __eou__ Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous . __eou__ Proper posture can show your confidence . __eou__ The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . __eou__ Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . __eou__ Throughout the interview you should maintain patience . __eou__ In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . __eou__ Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . __eou__

Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__ Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . __eou__
Where did you work as a teacher before ? __eou__ I taught English in a primary school in Beijing . __eou__ What teaching experience have you had ? __eou__ I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself . __eou__

The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . __eou__ Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . __eou__ But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . __eou__ That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . __eou__ Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
What do you think a job is ? __eou__ Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . __eou__ Where do you see yourself three years from now ? __eou__ I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . __eou__ That sounds reasonable . __eou__ It's the most important thing to me . __eou__ Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? __eou__ I think a company is a place to get work done .

Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ? __eou__ Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here . __eou__ First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information . __eou__ The position calls for a person with some working experience .

I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . __eou__ Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__ Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . __eou__ Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? __eou__ No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__ That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__ Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__ It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__ I guess you ’ re right .

Maybe you should have told me first ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because we're partners . __eou__ I realize that but I needed to make a decision . __eou__

Mary , why are you so tired ? __eou__ I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it . __eou__ Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet ? __eou__ On the Internet ? I have never tried that way . __eou__ Well , it's very convenient and very popular now . __eou__ So how to apply for a job on the Internet ? __eou__ Just get online and send your application through email to the employer . __eou__ But how can I know which employer is hiring ? __eou__ You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website . __eou__ Will the employers see my information ? __eou__ Yes .

Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer . __eou__ Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . __eou__ For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . __eou__

I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate . __eou__ Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago . __eou__ What did you take as your major in college ? __eou__ I took Accounting as my major . __eou__ What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? __eou__ I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . __eou__ All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? __eou__ There are two reasons for me to do it .

You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__ We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__ If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__ I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__ I'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__ We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . __eou__ All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__ You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__ Oh , that's pitiful . __eou__
Hello . Is this Ann ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Kelly ? __eou__ Yes , it's me . __eou__ Do you have a cold ? __eou__ No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__ Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__ Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__ Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__ Hope you feel better . __eou__
Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . __eou__ That's no problem . Let me see ...

How's your project coming along ? __eou__ The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . __eou__ Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__ Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . __eou__ I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . __eou__

It's spacious there . __eou__ We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . __eou__ I've arranged for an interpreter to be present .

We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . __eou__
What do you think of the project ? __eou__ Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us . __eou__ Are you interested in making this investment ? __eou__ We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do . __eou__

Today you can have a good rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ We hope your stay here a pleasant one ! __eou__ I believe I will . __eou__

I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__

By the way , when do you take over the new position ? __eou__ Next month . __eou__ So what are you responsible for ? __eou__ I'm going to manage the whole accounts department . __eou__ So you must get higher pay than before . __eou__ Yes , the company will also give me a prize of 1,000 Yuan . __eou__ 1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... __eou__ OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . __eou__ Really ? Can I order anything I want ? __eou__ Of course . Let's go . __eou__
I need help in ordering my office supplies . __eou__ You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site and turn in into me .

How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . __eou__ How do you do , Mr . James ?

What does the service involve ? __eou__ Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . __eou__ Can you carry out major repairs here ? __eou__ Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? __eou__

I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . __eou__ All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__

But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? __eou__ No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . __eou__ All right . I understand now .

Your price is much higher than other companies . __eou__ You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . __eou__ I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . __eou__ Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . __eou__ All right , we'll wait for your answer . __eou__

Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! __eou__ Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ Uh-huh . __eou__ But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__

How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . __eou__ How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . __eou__ Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . __eou__ I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__ That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__ That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__ I see your point .

What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices .

Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . __eou__ More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . __eou__
