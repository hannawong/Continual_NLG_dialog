Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name . __eou__ Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . __eou__ What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there . __eou__ Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? __eou__ Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? __eou__ They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . __eou__ Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it . __eou__ It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life . __eou__ Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth . __eou__ Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter . __eou__ There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . __eou__
Where do you work , Andrea ? __eou__ I work for Thomas Cook Travel . __eou__ Oh , really ? What do you do there ? __eou__ I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . __eou__ That sounds interesting ! __eou__ Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ? __eou__ I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too . __eou__ Oh ?

It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . __eou__
What ? __eou__ What happened with that guy at the cafe ? __eou__ nothing __eou__ But you ’ re crazy about him ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? __eou__ I don ’ t actually know him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . __eou__ Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . __eou__

Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? __eou__ I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . __eou__ Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . __eou__ I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . __eou__ Why don't you take a few days off ? __eou__ I can't . I am really behind of my work . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
I can ’ t decide what to do today . __eou__ Well . Let ’ s go swimming . __eou__ Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? __eou__ Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . __eou__
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ But everything has been so easy . __eou__ Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . __eou__ Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__

I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ He didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ That's what friends are for . __eou__

I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? __eou__ Two years or so . __eou__ That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? __eou__ No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . __eou__ Do you enjoy work here ? __eou__ It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . __eou__ Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . __eou__ Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . __eou__ Glad to hear that . __eou__
It's rather cold , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ Shall I light the stove ? __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ Well , what's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's mild , but it's not always pleasant . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Wu . __eou__ Good evening , Mr . Smith . __eou__ Have you met my wife , Mary ? __eou__ No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure . __eou__ Mary , this is Mr .

How about you ? __eou__ I enjoyed myself , too . __eou__ Shall I give you a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . __eou__ It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . __eou__ That's great . Let's go ! __eou__
Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! __eou__ That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . __eou__

I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand . __eou__ Me too . I like the festival best of all . __eou__ Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . __eou__ And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . __eou__ Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? __eou__ Such as ? __eou__ You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . __eou__ Why ? To welcome the new year of course ? __eou__ And also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . __eou__
How nice of you to come ! __eou__ It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? __eou__ Just fine , thanks.And you ? __eou__ I've never been better , thanks . __eou__
What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . __eou__ I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? __eou__ I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . __eou__ Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . __eou__ I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . __eou__ Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . __eou__
Another glass of beer , will you ? __eou__ Thanks , I'm enough . __eou__ At least one for your trip . __eou__ I'll have it if you insist . __eou__
Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__
He told the police that Ted was the murderer . __eou__ He is playing hob with the fact . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he stayed with me all the time that night . __eou__

What's the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ Neither too cold , nor too hot . __eou__ That's quite a lovely weather . __eou__ Yes , especially in spring . __eou__ Have you ever seen a hurricane ? __eou__ Once , when I was a child . __eou__ Do they often happen in your country ? __eou__ Now and then . __eou__ Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . __eou__
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ How many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice . __eou__ Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth . __eou__ You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times . __eou__ You mean Lily's boyfriend ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . __eou__
How can I tell her about this ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ How can you live without job in the future ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ So , you also like Coffee ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . __eou__ Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . __eou__ I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . __eou__ But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction __eou__ I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . __eou__ Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! __eou__ Maybe you are right to some extent . __eou__ You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . __eou__ Maybe I could have a try . __eou__
Do you like tea ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't know much about it . __eou__ Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . __eou__ My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . __eou__ Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . __eou__
I wonder if I can ask you a question . __eou__ Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ? __eou__ Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ... __eou__ Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know . __eou__ I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks . __eou__ Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? __eou__ Yeah . But I ... __eou__
Do you love me ? __eou__ I ’ m very fond of you . __eou__ Yes , but do you love me ? __eou__ Why ? You mean a lot to me . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? __eou__ What question ? __eou__ Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . __eou__ You know that I care for you . I .. I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I .. I don ’ t feel like saying it . __eou__
I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . __eou__ You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . __eou__ You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . __eou__ Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . __eou__ Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . __eou__ You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . __eou__ Maybe that's why he's so nice ! __eou__
Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . __eou__ Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! __eou__ Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? __eou__ Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . __eou__ Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . __eou__
Did you hear the good news ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__ I got a promotion at my job . __eou__ Did you really ? __eou__ Seriously , I am so excited . __eou__ Well , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I'm so happy for you . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . You really deserved this . __eou__ You think so ? __eou__ Yes . Good for you . __eou__
Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . __eou__ That's great . We can go to the bank together . __eou__ Why are you going there ? __eou__ I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . __eou__ I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? __eou__ Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . __eou__ Do you have the bank card in Japan ? __eou__ Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . __eou__ That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? __eou__ No . It is free of charge . __eou__ Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . __eou__ I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . __eou__
Beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all . __eou__ I wish it would stay this way for the weekend . __eou__ As long as it doesn't snow ! __eou__
Paul sends you his regards . __eou__ How nice of him ! __eou__
Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . __eou__ I heard about that . It was successful . __eou__ It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap . __eou__ I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . __eou__
Why weren't you at school yesterday ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling really well . __eou__ What was wrong with you ? __eou__ My stomach was upset . __eou__ Do you feel better now ? __eou__ I don't really feel too well yet . __eou__ Do you want anything to make you feel better ? __eou__ No , thanks . I already took some medicine . __eou__ I hope you feel better . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . __eou__ Yeah , she has a lot of homework . __eou__ Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . __eou__ Right . So in some way we are happier . __eou__ Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . __eou__
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . __eou__ According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . __eou__ But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . __eou__
Hi , Craig ! How are you ? __eou__ Not so good . I have a terrible cold . __eou__ Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . __eou__ And have you taken anything for it ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__ Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! __eou__ Ugh ! __eou__
Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . __eou__ Of course . How're you ? __eou__ Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . __eou__ I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . __eou__ Oh ... that's too bad . __eou__ Yeah . I really like Lesley . __eou__ Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . __eou__ Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ? __eou__ At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? __eou__ That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . __eou__ Sure ! __eou__ See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . __eou__
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options .

They folded and he made zip . __eou__ Ouch . __eou__ Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . __eou__

Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . __eou__ I had to go get a cavity filled today . __eou__ Did it hurt ? __eou__ I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! __eou__ How long were you in the chair ? __eou__ It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything . __eou__
I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . __eou__ Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . __eou__ Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one . __eou__
Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? __eou__ Which one will you be going to ? __eou__ We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . __eou__ Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ OK , can I bring a date with me ? __eou__ Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . __eou__ Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . __eou__ I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . __eou__ One last question.Is there a dress code there ? __eou__ No , its very casual there .

Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months ! __eou__ You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? __eou__ Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! __eou__ Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists . __eou__ Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . __eou__ All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . __eou__

Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! __eou__ Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . __eou__ Who taught you to put on make-up ? __eou__ It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . __eou__ Can you teach me how to do make-up ? __eou__ Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . __eou__ What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? __eou__ I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . __eou__ How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? __eou__ I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . __eou__ How did you grow such long nails ? __eou__ You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . __eou__

Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? __eou__ Because they are rednecks . __eou__
How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ? __eou__ Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . __eou__ Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . __eou__
What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm feeling a little under the weather . __eou__
Are there any hobbies you do ? __eou__ When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint . __eou__ Oh , you actually do that ? __eou__ Every so often , I do . __eou__ Did you always know how to draw and paint ? __eou__ I was taught in high school how to draw and paint . __eou__ You had an art class ? __eou__ Exactly , it was my favorite class . __eou__ Well , it's good that you're so talented . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__ Talent is a great thing , I wish I had one . __eou__ Everyone has a talent .

Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . __eou__ Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? __eou__ I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . __eou__ What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? __eou__ I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ I'm sure management is on top of it . __eou__
Do you like to dance ? __eou__ Sometimes , if there's music playing . __eou__ What kind of dancing do you like ? __eou__ It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . __eou__
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . __eou__ Yes , I can see .

But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh yes !

I was born in Beijing , actually . __eou__ I see.so this is your hometown ? __eou__

My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . __eou__ In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . __eou__ You are right . What about shoes ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes are OK . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__

Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . __eou__ Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? __eou__ No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! __eou__ Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? __eou__ Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . __eou__ You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? __eou__ My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . __eou__ If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . __eou__ That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! __eou__
Look , there are some words on the fish . __eou__ I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? __eou__ Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__ You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . __eou__ Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . __eou__ Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? __eou__ OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? __eou__
I don't think I'm getting better . __eou__ Believe me , you really look much better than before . __eou__ I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . __eou__
My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year . __eou__ What happens on the holiday ? __eou__ Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . __eou__ Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ? __eou__ Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . __eou__
Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ She must be a good wife . __eou__ Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ I see . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go ! __eou__
Bon voyage ! __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Tina , It's Joe . __eou__ Hi Joe . __eou__ How's the weather there today ? __eou__ It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . __eou__ What's the temperature ? __eou__ It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too . How's the weather where you are ? __eou__ It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . __eou__

Why is little Billy crying ? __eou__ He got a scolding . __eou__
So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? __eou__ Well , I like to play the piano . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? __eou__ About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . __eou__ That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . __eou__ Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ What about a factory tour ? __eou__ You mean visit a factory ? __eou__ Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ Really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go . __eou__ Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I am afraid not . __eou__ Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon . __eou__ Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . __eou__ Yes , I will . Take care , then . __eou__ Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream ! __eou__
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian . __eou__
What's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ Any rain ? __eou__ No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . __eou__ I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . __eou__ Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . __eou__
Hey , where's Cindy ? __eou__ She told me that she's got tennis practice today . __eou__ You're Mary , right ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ Cindy told me about you in our gym class . __eou__ I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? __eou__ My house is next door to yours . __eou__ Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . __eou__ Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . __eou__
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__ But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ Thanks for coming . __eou__ How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . __eou__ Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . __eou__ Well . I really do have to go . __eou__ Good night then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ That ’ s open secret . __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ How did you know that ? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes , twice . __eou__
Give me Scotch , please . __eou__ What brand ? __eou__ Black Rose . __eou__ Soda or water ? __eou__ Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . __eou__ All right . Please wait for a minute . __eou__
Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__ Maybe some other time . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many crazy about it __eou__ I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
Nice day , isn't it ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ It's a good day for a picnic . __eou__
Can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ What are you reading ? __eou__ I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . __eou__ Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ? __eou__ He got arrested all right . __eou__ If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire . __eou__ That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__ Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves . __eou__ So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ? __eou__ He's giving lectures on business at colleges . __eou__
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . __eou__ When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? __eou__ I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . __eou__ That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? __eou__ Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! __eou__ How do you get enough protein in your diet ? __eou__ Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . __eou__ Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? __eou__ I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . __eou__ How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? __eou__ That sounds great . What time should I come over ? __eou__ Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there ! __eou__
Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? __eou__ The balcony is still available . __eou__ Aren't there any other seats ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that's it . __eou__

Do you know her ? __eou__ Yes , I know her . We're friends . __eou__ Who's that man standing next to her ? __eou__ Which man ? __eou__ That short guy on her right . What's his name ? __eou__ Oh , that's Matt . __eou__ He's really good looking . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Do you know him ? __eou__ I don't know him , but I think my sister does . __eou__ Is he married ? __eou__ Yes , he's married . __eou__ I remember now . I met him before . __eou__
Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? __eou__ No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . __eou__ I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . __eou__ Great , let ’ s go ! __eou__
Don't you think it's nice out ? __eou__ Yes , I think so too . __eou__ I think that it's going to rain . __eou__ I hope that it does rain . __eou__ You like the rain ? __eou__ The sky looks so clean after it rains .

You forgot it , too . __eou__ you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__ is that your phone ? __eou__ oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__ wow ! good timing . __eou__ he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__ come on ! three's a crowd ! __eou__ so what ? __eou__ just go ! it's Valentine's Day ! __eou__

Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ? __eou__ Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired . __eou__ It's probably jet lag . __eou__ I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . __eou__ Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? __eou__ Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . __eou__ Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . __eou__
I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 . __eou__ Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel . __eou__ A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . __eou__ I prefer boxing to beef . __eou__

How's John doing ? __eou__ He can barely make ends meet . __eou__
Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . __eou__ Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . __eou__ Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly . __eou__ That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . __eou__ Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . __eou__ Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? __eou__ Just as Forrest ? __eou__ Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . __eou__ I got it . __eou__
I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday . __eou__ I wanted to go , but I couldn't . __eou__ It was a great game . __eou__ It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ? __eou__ Our team played hard and won . __eou__ I really wish I went to the game . __eou__ It was the best game ever . __eou__ So tell me the final score . __eou__ The other team lost by three points , 101-98 . __eou__ It must've been a close game . __eou__ It really was . You should've gone . __eou__ Hopefully , I'll make it to the next one . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
Do you know what the BBS is ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Tell me then . __eou__ BBS means Bulletin Board Service . __eou__ Oh , I see , but what's it used for ? __eou__ A lot of things ! __eou__ Tell me in details . __eou__ Okay .

so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? __eou__ to be honest , I don't really care for either one . __eou__ I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? __eou__ I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . __eou__ that makes sense . __eou__ how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? __eou__ my absolute favorite is ice hockey . __eou__ have you ever seen a live game ? __eou__ sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . __eou__ I've never really understood the game . __eou__ it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . __eou__ thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ? __eou__ not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__
Do you like flowers ? __eou__ Of course , I like flowers . __eou__ What's your favorite flower ? __eou__ I like peach blossom , because I like spring . __eou__ Peach blossom is really beautiful . __eou__ Yes . How about you ? __eou__ I like lotus . __eou__ You have a perfect taste ! __eou__ But there aren't any lotus now . __eou__ Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . __eou__ That's not bad . Let's go . __eou__
This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . __eou__ I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . __eou__
I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . __eou__ OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . __eou__ Good night . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . __eou__ I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . __eou__
Uh ... that's Greek to me . __eou__ That means they have tapered legs . __eou__ Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . __eou__ Mine are , too . __eou__ So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . __eou__ Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! __eou__

Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . __eou__
Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes .

What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feeling's exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__
does your family have a record of your ancestors ? __eou__ sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . __eou__ do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . __eou__ I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__

She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . __eou__ Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . __eou__ But , well ... what I want to say is ... __eou__ Stop acting like this . Say away ! __eou__ Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ Give her up . __eou__
Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . __eou__ Hackneyed theme ! __eou__ What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? __eou__ Nearly everything . __eou__ You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? __eou__ Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ Mm . What came after that ? __eou__ After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . __eou__ Pretty good . Please continue . __eou__ Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ Any more ? __eou__ Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__
Where do you plan to go this winter ? __eou__ Alps , suppose . __eou__ Oh , yes , you like skiing . __eou__ Right . __eou__
When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? __eou__ I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__ That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__ That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__ Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . __eou__ Did you ? How is he these days ? __eou__ He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . __eou__ I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? __eou__ Of course . What do you want to move first ? __eou__ Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . __eou__
Could you just hold this for me ? __eou__ What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ? __eou__ Yes , but I've nearly fixed it . Just take it , will you ? __eou__ Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ... __eou__

It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " __eou__ when did you send her a letter ? __eou__ just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . __eou__ I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . __eou__ ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . __eou__ that's fine with me . __eou__ oh . It's actually all rather personal . __eou__ well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . __eou__ ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " __eou__ are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? __eou__ didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . __eou__ oh , I guess I missed that . __eou__ men ! __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . __eou__
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn't know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . __eou__

It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . __eou__ It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . __eou__
I wonder who that man is . __eou__ Which man ? __eou__ The one smoking a cigar . __eou__ Oh , he's the coach of the football team . __eou__
It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . __eou__ It ’ s a typical of them to do so . __eou__ What can we do ? __eou__ We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . __eou__
Mary is such a cautious girl ! __eou__ What do you mean by cautious ? __eou__ She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . __eou__ Thats a clever way to escape responsibility . __eou__

Hello ! __eou__ Oh , hi ! __eou__ Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . __eou__ Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? __eou__ Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? __eou__ No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? __eou__ I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? __eou__ I am an accountant at a company . __eou__ Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . __eou__ It's nice meeting you too , Alice . __eou__ See you around ! __eou__ Goodbye , Alice . __eou__

Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . __eou__
Mary , I have something to tell you . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you . __eou__ Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . __eou__ John made out with other girls at the party yesterday . __eou__
Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ? __eou__ I have no idea . To be honest , I couldn't care less . __eou__
Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . __eou__ Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ We can go to a horror movie , and I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared . __eou__ You mean ... like on a second date ? __eou__ Of course ! Or are you still too scared ! __eou__ No way ! That sounds great ! __eou__
What should we do this Saturday ? __eou__ Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . __eou__ The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . __eou__ True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . __eou__ How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . __eou__ Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . __eou__
Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__

Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__
What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? __eou__ I can't remember . __eou__ It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' . __eou__
I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand . __eou__ me . too i like the festival best of all . __eou__ Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . __eou__ And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . __eou__ Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? __eou__ Such as ... __eou__ You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . __eou__ Why ? to welcome the new year of course . __eou__ And also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels . __eou__
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ What kind of house is it ? __eou__ It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . __eou__ Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . __eou__ And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ Right , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

Thanks for suggesting that great movie . __eou__ I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday . __eou__ I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ? __eou__ Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . __eou__ Fine then , what time are we going to leave ? __eou__ I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad . __eou__ Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then ! __eou__

Do you like it ? __eou__ Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? __eou__ At the mall on 5th street . __eou__ Was it expensive ? __eou__ No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . __eou__ That's cheap . __eou__ I know . It was a really good deal . __eou__ I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ That's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ No . did you ? __eou__ Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! __eou__
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ Sure . Meet me at five . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__
See you later , alligator . __eou__ In a while , crocodile . __eou__
I like pop music very much . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ Is it ? __eou__
Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ? __eou__ Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic . __eou__ Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ? __eou__ Oh , just olives please . What music is this ? __eou__ Do you like it ? It's Irish music . __eou__ It's great ! Where did you get the CD ? __eou__ Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ? __eou__ Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Why not ? I'd love to ! __eou__
Delicious ! Did you make this chocolate cake yourself , Fred ? __eou__ Yes . I did . __eou__ It's really good . __eou__
Small world , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , it is . __eou__ I never imagined meeting you here . __eou__ It's really a surprise . __eou__
You look tired . __eou__ Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ Really ? How come ? __eou__ My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult . __eou__ You shouldn't work so hard . __eou__ I know , but hard work pays off . You know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for . __eou__
Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? __eou__ It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . __eou__ We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__ Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . __eou__ That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . __eou__ Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . __eou__ So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . __eou__ Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? __eou__ The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles . __eou__ We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . __eou__
What ? You want to leave early ? __eou__ Yes . Can I ? __eou__ Do you really need to ? __eou__ Yes . Is it OK with you ? __eou__ Is it important ? __eou__ Yes . Do you mind ? __eou__ You really have to ? __eou__ Yes . Will you let me ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ? __eou__ What a good idea ! __eou__ So let's get registered tomorrow . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Peter and Mary broke up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__
Can you tell me a little about Paris ? __eou__ Sure . What do you expect to know ? __eou__ I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... __eou__ And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum . You can stay there for at least a whole day . __eou__ That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? __eou__ The night life there . It's so romantic ! __eou__ Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? __eou__ I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . __eou__ Sounds exciting . I can't wait . __eou__
Wow , is that your sports car ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ When's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ It must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ What else is wrong with it ? __eou__ The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ Why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
How was your vacation in Paris ? __eou__ It was exciting ! __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
What a nice tie you are wearing ! __eou__ Thank you.But does it really look all right ? __eou__ Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . __eou__ Then does it go well with my sweater ? __eou__ Yes.You look very smart today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I have no idea about what to do next . __eou__ Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks . __eou__ Let me have a try . __eou__
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? __eou__ I had to look after my son at home . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a fever . __eou__ Is he getting better now ? __eou__ I think so.Thank you . __eou__
Can we talk ? __eou__ Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ You know what I mean . __eou__ Yeah . I know . __eou__ I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... __eou__ You know , I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ Honey ... __eou__ Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ Baby , I love you so much . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ Oh , I love you too ! __eou__ Come on . Put the gun down . __eou__ Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time ! __eou__
I'm leaving now , mum . __eou__ Take care , sonny ! __eou__ I will.Bye - bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . __eou__ Here . Are you all right ? __eou__ Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . __eou__ I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . __eou__ No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . __eou__ Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . __eou__ I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . __eou__ You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . __eou__ Do I ? Oh , no . __eou__ Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? __eou__ What about Mr.White ? __eou__ I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . __eou__ Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . __eou__
Although you spare no effort to complete the project . I think you have missed the boat . __eou__ I will not miss the boat when there is another opportunity again next time . __eou__
What did he say ? __eou__ He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . __eou__ It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . __eou__ Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . __eou__
Do you believe in UFOs ? __eou__ Of course , they are out there . __eou__ But I never saw them . __eou__ Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . __eou__ You mean that you can them . __eou__ That's right . I can see them in my dreams . __eou__ They come to the earth ? __eou__ No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . __eou__ Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? __eou__ OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . __eou__ That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? __eou__ Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . __eou__ Wow . Sounds fantastic ! __eou__
Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__ Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . __eou__
Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? __eou__ Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . __eou__ What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . __eou__ Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . __eou__ What am I going to do ? __eou__ Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__ Is she American ? __eou__ Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__ Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? __eou__ Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . __eou__ They must be amazing animals . __eou__ They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . __eou__ I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . __eou__ They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . __eou__

Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__ We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ Let's hope it is ! __eou__

Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Did you have a fight with Jack ? __eou__ No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__ You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__ Is that your phone ? __eou__ Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__ Wow ! Good timing . __eou__ He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__ Come on ! Three's a crowd ! __eou__ So what ? __eou__ Just go !

You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . __eou__ Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? __eou__ I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . __eou__ You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? __eou__ Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . __eou__ I agree . I appreciate your helping me . __eou__
What food do you fancy ? __eou__ I feel like something good to eat . __eou__ How about going to Joe's Restaurant . __eou__ Hey , that sounds a good idea . __eou__

So I ended up with a terrible seat , All the way up in the front row . It was one of my worst movie experiences ever . __eou__ Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row . __eou__ By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket .

It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . __eou__ I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . __eou__ Well , it may rain again later today . __eou__ Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . __eou__ There may also be a strong wind coming in . __eou__ It'll be dusty , too , I guess . __eou__ Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ We've been planting trees for many years . __eou__ I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . __eou__ But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . __eou__ Then what about spring ? __eou__ Spring is warm and short in Beijing . __eou__ It must be cold in the winter , though . __eou__ You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year .

Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? __eou__ I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . __eou__ Then let's go in . __eou__ I can't .

He's done this before , hasn't he ? __eou__ Yeah , a number of times . __eou__ What's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__ I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . __eou__ Maybe you should start seeing someone else . __eou__ You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . __eou__
Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . __eou__ OK , please . __eou__ My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? __eou__ I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . __eou__ Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? __eou__ How old are your children ? __eou__ I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . __eou__ I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . __eou__ It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I've had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't had much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... __eou__ and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? __eou__ How ? __eou__ Because I won't let it fail . __eou__ But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? __eou__
what's up ? __eou__ not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . __eou__ Are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__ actually , I've got a wireless connection . __eou__ In that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__ I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . __eou__ do you like ever chat online ? __eou__ No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__ Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__ what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? __eou__ well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . __eou__ what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__ it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__ cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__ don't mention it . __eou__
Her dress looks funny . __eou__ I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . __eou__ Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . __eou__ Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . __eou__ Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . __eou__ You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style __eou__ No wonder you never buy me a new dress . __eou__
Is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for __eou__ Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . __eou__
Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ? __eou__ Take your pick , Julie . __eou__
How do I look in this new dress ? __eou__ You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . __eou__
Well , here is your breakfast ! __eou__ Thanks so much . Miss , I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled , and these are fried . __eou__ Sorry , your friend over there ordered fried eggs , and I gave you his by mistake . __eou__ Oh yeah . Here , I will just trade with him . __eou__ Here are your pancakes , madam . __eou__ But I ordered waffles ! __eou__ Oh , I am so sorry ! __eou__ That's OK . I will eat my eggs and bacon , and you can take my pancakes back . __eou__ Good , sir . I will take care of that right away . __eou__ Thank you so much ! __eou__
What shall we do after the volleyball match ? __eou__ How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . __eou__ That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . __eou__ Me , too . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . __eou__ I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan __eou__ Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? __eou__ The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . __eou__ Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? __eou__ I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . __eou__ Any other ideas ? __eou__ There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . __eou__ It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . __eou__
Have you heard about Alice and David ? __eou__ No , have they had another fight ? __eou__ No , they've got engaged . __eou__ You must be joking . Those two ? __eou__ Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . __eou__ So when did this all happen ? __eou__ Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip . __eou__ Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? __eou__ Next June . __eou__ I can hardly believe it . __eou__
They're very good friends , aren't they ? __eou__ I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other . __eou__ Oh , it's unbelievable ! __eou__
How was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__
Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . __eou__ If we hurry , can we get there in time ? __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__
You may not remember me.My name is Joe Brown . __eou__ Yes , of course . I'm Jimmy White . __eou__ Nice to see you again . __eou__ Same here . __eou__
I can't go to your party . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__
Are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
Sally , do you really need to go ? __eou__ Yeah.It ' s a must for me . __eou__ But don't forget to give me a ring . __eou__ I won't , mum . __eou__
Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . __eou__ I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Forget it . __eou__ I don't think I performed well . __eou__ Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . __eou__ Can you tell me how to improve myself ? __eou__ There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . __eou__ Thank you for your encouragement . __eou__ It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . __eou__
I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? __eou__ That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? __eou__ To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . __eou__ It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . __eou__ Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? __eou__ Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . __eou__
Charles , have you finished your homework ? __eou__ Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? __eou__ I want you to have a walk with me . __eou__ I'll finish soon . __eou__
You know them ? __eou__ No , but those guys like to hit on me . __eou__
Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . __eou__ He spoke evil behind his back . __eou__ How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? __eou__ Someone told Joe off . __eou__ He is then in a very difficult situation . __eou__ Sure . He ’ ll get the bag , I think . __eou__
Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? __eou__ Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . __eou__ Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . __eou__ Yes , me too . __eou__ I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . __eou__
Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I didn't have any big plans . __eou__ We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? __eou__ We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . __eou__ Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? __eou__ We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . __eou__ I am assuming that the dress is casual . __eou__ Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! __eou__ Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . __eou__
I really want to go to the beach this weekend . __eou__ That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ? __eou__ I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend . __eou__ Is it going to be perfect beach weather ? __eou__ I believe so . __eou__ Good . I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . __eou__ I know . I really want to go to the beach . __eou__ But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . __eou__ You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . __eou__ I really wish the weather would just stay the same . __eou__ I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time . __eou__ Yeah , that would make things a lot easier . __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__
Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about having dinner with me ? __eou__ That's great . I would love to . And when ? __eou__ Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ? __eou__ No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything . __eou__ All right , see you tonight . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
wow ! You're going to Tibet ? __eou__ yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . __eou__ that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . __eou__ great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? __eou__ nothing particular . __eou__ why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . __eou__ oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . __eou__ come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . __eou__ ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? __eou__ the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . __eou__ then make sure that you book me a room , too . __eou__ I'll take care of it . __eou__ and check whether they accept credit cards . __eou__ no problem . __eou__
Long time no see ! __eou__ Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . __eou__ It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? __eou__ No . I've been visiting relatives recently . __eou__ That's nice . Where have you been ? __eou__ I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco . __eou__ Are you busy now ? __eou__ No . Why ? __eou__ How about a coffee in that cafe ? __eou__ Great . Let's talk over coffee . __eou__
Do you like ethnic food ? __eou__ I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . __eou__ Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? __eou__ I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? __eou__ I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . __eou__ Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . __eou__ Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! __eou__
It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? __eou__ I have found myself a date mate . __eou__ You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . __eou__ A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . __eou__
After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . __eou__ Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . __eou__ Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . __eou__ Thanks . You too . __eou__
Bob is getting on in years . __eou__ Yeah , I'm very worried about his health . __eou__ He looks tired all the time . __eou__ He's working too hard . __eou__
Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . __eou__ Maybe we're walking in circles . __eou__ Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . __eou__
Something wrong ? __eou__ Yes . My car is having problems . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ It won't start . __eou__ Do you want me to take a look ? __eou__ No , thank you . I think I can handle it . __eou__ Well , if you change your mind , let me know . __eou__ I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? __eou__ Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . __eou__ Thanks . That would be very helpful . __eou__ Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__ OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . __eou__
Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__
I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . __eou__ Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . __eou__ I ’ m so thirsty . __eou__ Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . __eou__ No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . __eou__ I ’ ll buy you a drink . __eou__ Oh ! Thank you . __eou__
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . __eou__ It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . __eou__ Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . __eou__ I'm sorry . What's your name again ? __eou__ Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . __eou__ So Barb ... what do you do ? __eou__ I'm studying medicine . __eou__ Really ? Where ? __eou__ At Harvard . What about you ? __eou__ I'm an engineer at IBM . __eou__ Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . __eou__ Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . __eou__ Good . I'm starving . __eou__
Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? __eou__ Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . __eou__ How many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ I don't care . I need money . __eou__ Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . __eou__ Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
Have you heard of Paul ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He's got a promotion . __eou__ You're kidding . __eou__ No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__ Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . __eou__ Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . __eou__ Well . Good for him . __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__
Are you free tonight ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__
What's going on ? __eou__ Nothing really . How about you ? __eou__ A lot , like the party I'm having on Friday . __eou__ Well , that's cool . __eou__ Will you be able to make it ? __eou__ I'm busy this Friday . I'm sorry . __eou__ What do you have to do ? __eou__ I'm having dinner with my family __eou__ Maybe you can come next time . __eou__ I'll make sure and come to your next party . __eou__ I'll look for you at my next party . __eou__ I'll be there . __eou__
Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? __eou__ Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ? __eou__ I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan . __eou__ And they , too , want to make sure their loan is worthwhile . __eou__
Betty was in hospital . __eou__ I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . __eou__ She suffers from cancer . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . __eou__
Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? __eou__ Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? __eou__ Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . __eou__ What's in it ? __eou__ Have a guess . __eou__ A necklace ? __eou__ No . __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Open it now . __eou__ Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! __eou__ You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future . __eou__
May I know who's calling ? __eou__ Hello , this is David . __eou__ Glad to hear your voice , David . __eou__
May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail . __eou__ Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . __eou__
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . __eou__
You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . __eou__ Do you get along with your parents now ? __eou__ Oh , sure .

This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . __eou__ No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! __eou__ Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . __eou__ No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! __eou__ It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . __eou__
I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great !

Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . __eou__ It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . __eou__ What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? __eou__ Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . __eou__ When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . __eou__ You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . __eou__ I know that's what I must do . __eou__
It's snowing outside . __eou__ Oh , how could it be ? __eou__ Let's go out and have a look . __eou__ OK . Wait a minute . __eou__ Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . __eou__ Yes .

Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? __eou__ What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ?

Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! __eou__
May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? __eou__ Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . __eou__ I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? __eou__ Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . __eou__ It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__

It's an ugly day today . __eou__ I know . I think it may rain . __eou__ It's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . __eou__ That would be weird . __eou__ Yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . __eou__ I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . __eou__ Yes , it would be . __eou__ I really wish it wasn't so hot every day . __eou__ Me too . I can't wait until winter . __eou__ I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . __eou__ I'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice . __eou__ Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . __eou__

I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__
I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . __eou__ I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! __eou__ It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . __eou__ Do you believe what they say ? __eou__ Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? __eou__ Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist . __eou__

Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I ’ m going to Hainan . __eou__ Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? __eou__ Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . __eou__ I see . What ’ s it like there ? __eou__ Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city .

You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . __eou__ What is your current occupation ? __eou__ I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . __eou__
Guess what I just heard ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ The boss is planning to sell the company . __eou__ You must be joking ! __eou__
I think I'll write a book . __eou__ What about ? __eou__ All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . __eou__ You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . __eou__ The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . __eou__ Because you can see the results with the general public ? __eou__ That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . __eou__ I would buy that kind of book ! __eou__
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__ Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . __eou__ How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! __eou__ Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__
Excuse me . Nature calls . __eou__ If you gotta go , you gotta go . __eou__
What did you think of the movie ? __eou__ I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . __eou__ I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . __eou__ I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ? __eou__ Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie . __eou__ Thanks for the sweet words . __eou__ Any time . __eou__
It's one of the highlights of the match . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The wonderful passing Melaena did . __eou__ Too bad I missed it . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
Who is it ? __eou__ Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . __eou__ You're always so careless . __eou__ Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? __eou__ Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . __eou__ So let's eat out . __eou__ What do you want to eat ? __eou__ Noodles . How about you ? __eou__ Dumplings . __eou__
Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . __eou__ Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . __eou__ And after church they come here for lunch ? __eou__ Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up with that ? __eou__ The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! __eou__
Terrible . How about people's lives ? __eou__ Fortunately , there is no person died . __eou__ That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . __eou__ Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . __eou__ That's why many people died in the earthquake . __eou__ Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . __eou__ Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__ Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . __eou__ We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . __eou__ Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . __eou__ That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . __eou__
how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? __eou__ I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__ as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
I don't think we've met . __eou__ No , I don't think we have . __eou__ My name is Dick Brown . __eou__ How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood . __eou__ Mr . Smith often talked about you . __eou__ Really ? I am glad to meet you . __eou__ I'm honored to know you . __eou__
Did you find what you were looking for ? __eou__ I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . __eou__ Okay , let's both look for it now . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . __eou__ I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? __eou__ why not ? I love animals and I love nature . __eou__ You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . __eou__ sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . __eou__ Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . __eou__ That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . __eou__ I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__ Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . __eou__ I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . __eou__ Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . __eou__ It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . __eou__ No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . __eou__
We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . __eou__ Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . __eou__ Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . __eou__ Gee , that's really nice of you . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__
So you are green with envy at your neighbor ? __eou__ Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn . __eou__ But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life . __eou__
It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . __eou__ That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . __eou__ I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . __eou__ That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . __eou__
Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . __eou__
He's too young for the job . __eou__ Give him a chance . __eou__
How many days do you take off for Easter ? __eou__ Usually we have a month off . __eou__ What will you do for this Easter ? __eou__ I'll stay at home and have a complete rest . __eou__
Thank you very much for your dinner . __eou__ Thank you for your coming . __eou__ My wife is expecting me at home . I must be off now.So long ! __eou__ So long ! __eou__
Who's your favorite singer ? __eou__ Coco Lee . __eou__
Did you get a nice tree ? __eou__ Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? __eou__ Let's put it over there . __eou__ Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . __eou__ Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations . __eou__ Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . __eou__ There , ... we're about done . __eou__ Let's switch the lights on . __eou__ OK . Here goes . __eou__ Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas . __eou__
Would you mind if I smoked ? __eou__ I'd rather you didn't . __eou__
We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year . __eou__ Whose name did you pick ? __eou__ I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? __eou__ Booze ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . __eou__
Why do you go fishing so often ? __eou__ It's fun . __eou__
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . __eou__
How is everything going with your girlfriend ? __eou__ Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__ It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__ Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? __eou__ No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__ What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__ I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__ I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! __eou__ I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . __eou__ I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? __eou__ I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . __eou__ I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . __eou__
