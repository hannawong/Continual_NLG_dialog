Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that .

First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate .

You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !

I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so .

People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __sou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .

These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __sou__ I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .

Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __sou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .
