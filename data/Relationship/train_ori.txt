Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . __eou__ Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! __eou__ Master Li ?

What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? __eou__ No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . __eou__ Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ? __eou__ Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! __eou__ Yeah . Other than that , the real feature is the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? __eou__ Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . __eou__ Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? __eou__ Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . __eou__ I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . __eou__ Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ) __eou__ Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ? __eou__ Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends . __eou__ Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great . __eou__ Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ? __eou__ Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first . __eou__ OK . Let me help you to hold the drink . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Holly , I just heard some terrible news . __eou__ Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? __eou__ No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! __eou__
George , is your chicken OK ? __eou__ It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? __eou__ My fish is very dry . __eou__ I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . __eou__ That's exactly what I was thinking had happened . __eou__ Are your vegetables OK ? __eou__ The vegetables are kind of mushy . __eou__ So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long . __eou__ The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . __eou__ I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something . __eou__
Do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , I don't smoke . __eou__
I think I need a new notebook . __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! __eou__
Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ Wow ! Sure ! __eou__ I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ I'd love to help if I can . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! __eou__ Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . __eou__ Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? __eou__ I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . __eou__ I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . __eou__ Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . __eou__
What do you think of the coming match ? __eou__ Winning is a piece of cake to me . __eou__ You are bragging again . __eou__
Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . __eou__ That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? __eou__ You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . __eou__ Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . __eou__ Please go ahead , I am listening . __eou__ I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . __eou__ Is your back door higher than the ground level ? __eou__ Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . __eou__ Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . __eou__ I don't like things to be fancy . __eou__ Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . __eou__ Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? __eou__ Cedar is a good choice . __eou__ Well , let's take the measurements right now . __eou__
You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays ! __eou__ Don ’ t tell me !

This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . __eou__ Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . __eou__ I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . __eou__ And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? __eou__ Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . __eou__ Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . __eou__
Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon . __eou__ Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . __eou__
Jack's been looking unhappy lately . __eou__ His girlfriend broke up with him . __eou__ No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . __eou__
Hey , Mike , is Jenny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Nothing . I'm just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? ! __eou__ Come on , Ted , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . __eou__ What're you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you're feeling about her . __eou__ I'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! Even though you are rejected , it's not the end of the world ! There's nothing to lose , is there ? __eou__ I don't know ... Well , maybe , you're right , but how am I going to tell her ? __eou__

They are all excellent dancers . __eou__ The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? __eou__ Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . __eou__ Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . __eou__ That ’ s really unbearable . __eou__ But you know , things cannot always go as you expect . __eou__ So get prepared for everything . __eou__
Are you a happy married man ? __eou__ Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . __eou__ You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . __eou__ I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . __eou__ You mean she bosses her husband around ? __eou__ That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . __eou__
May I have your attention please ? __eou__ Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? __eou__ Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... __eou__ Quiet everybody ! __eou__

Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? __eou__ Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . __eou__ Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . __eou__ Well have a good time .

Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? __eou__ I'm at home painting . __eou__ I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? __eou__ I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . __eou__ That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . __eou__ I think I will . Thanks for the info . __eou__
John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . __eou__ I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ What is your idea ? __eou__ Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . __eou__

I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__ I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . __eou__
How annoying ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program . __eou__

that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ? __eou__ very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
Did you understand question number three ? __eou__ Not at all , I was totally in the dark . __eou__
Flowers for my favorite girl . __eou__ How did you know that I love red roses ? __eou__ That's a secret .

Oh . you're a good dancer . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you . __eou__ I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . __eou__

Bob's sister will go to America . __eou__ Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! __eou__ I thought you wanted to know more about her . __eou__ No , I couldn't care less ! __eou__
Do you have girlfriend ? __eou__ Yes , why ? __eou__ Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So I think I may fall in love with her . __eou__ That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? __eou__ Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? __eou__ That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . __eou__ That's what I do . __eou__ And you think about her all the time ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . __eou__ That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . __eou__ Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . __eou__ Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . __eou__ Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . __eou__ Yeah , falling in love is so good . __eou__
How nice it is here . __eou__ You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . __eou__ That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . __eou__
Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . __eou__ Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . __eou__ Yes , it deserves its name . __eou__ Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? __eou__ Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? __eou__ They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . __eou__ It's interesting and I want to buy one home . __eou__
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ But everything has been so easy . __eou__ Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . __eou__ Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! __eou__ I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__ Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . __eou__ Banker ? __eou__ Yes ... __eou__ Can I have my $ 200 please ? __eou__ Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . __eou__
When will the ceremony begin ? __eou__ The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? __eou__ No idea . __eou__ As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . __eou__
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ? __eou__ I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories . __eou__ I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ? __eou__ I'm fond of history books . __eou__ Oh , the history books are dull to me . __eou__
Is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . __eou__
It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . __eou__ No kidding . Time is running out . __eou__ It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . __eou__ Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through . __eou__ Do you think we'll make it ? __eou__ I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . __eou__
OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . __eou__ Well , thank you . __eou__ What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? __eou__ Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . __eou__ Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . __eou__ Do ya ? __eou__ Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . __eou__ It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . __eou__ That's pretty tough ! __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Where did you have it done ? __eou__ My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? __eou__ Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . __eou__ Well , it looks very nice . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Can you read what this says ? __eou__ Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face . __eou__ Don't dis my hair ! I like it like this . __eou__ You like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you . __eou__ Hey , that's enough about my hair . __eou__ I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too . __eou__ I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute . __eou__ Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? __eou__
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . __eou__
Do you feel all right ? You look Pale . __eou__ All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . __eou__ Have you taken your temperature ? __eou__ No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish . __eou__ How long have you been feeling this way ? __eou__ Only since this morning . __eou__ Oh , probably you've been working too hard . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . __eou__ Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? __eou__ Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . __eou__
Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? __eou__ Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . __eou__ What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . __eou__ Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . __eou__ What am I going to do ? __eou__ Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . __eou__
Do you have brothers and sisters ? __eou__ No , I am the only child in my family . __eou__ Oh , I have an elder sister . She is married .. Her husband is a businessman . __eou__ Do they live with you and your parents ? __eou__ No , they live alone . __eou__
What would you like to be in the future ? __eou__ A teacher . __eou__ But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . __eou__ I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . __eou__ Are you sure about that ? __eou__ I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children . __eou__
There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . __eou__ I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? __eou__ ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . __eou__
I don't dare ask Jane for a date . __eou__ You've got no guts ! __eou__
Can I get you something to drink ? __eou__ No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . __eou__ I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? __eou__ It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? __eou__ About six years ... __eou__ What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . __eou__ Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? __eou__ That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! __eou__
That man's really a bore to me . __eou__ Which one do you mean ? __eou__ The man with his hair cropped . __eou__
Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ? __eou__ Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ? __eou__ This one . __eou__ Do I have to focus it ? __eou__ No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button . __eou__ All right . Say cheese ! __eou__
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . __eou__ Oh , do you go hiking often ? __eou__ I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . __eou__ It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? __eou__ Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? __eou__ Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . __eou__ Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__ Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . __eou__ Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . __eou__ Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__ No problem.Call me when you get back . __eou__ I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? __eou__ That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Are you free tonight ? __eou__ Depends . __eou__
Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ? __eou__ I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games . __eou__ How do you spend your spare time ? __eou__ I usually read or entertain myself . __eou__ What kind of books are you interested in ? __eou__ My favorite books are those about detectives . __eou__ Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ? __eou__ When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance . __eou__
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ you're dancing so well . __eou__ you dance beautifully too . __eou__ when did you learn to dance ? __eou__ in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ how about tango ? __eou__ oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . __eou__ thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ ok . __eou__
I think that you look very cute today . __eou__ Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit . __eou__ What store did you get it from ? __eou__ I went to Macy's and picked it out . __eou__ I love your outfit right now . __eou__ Well , I think you look nice today too . __eou__ Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store . __eou__ I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ? __eou__ These are Chucks . __eou__ Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ? __eou__ They only cost me about forty dollars . __eou__ I'm going to go get a pair for myself . __eou__
What's your favourite steps ? __eou__ It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much . __eou__ How about rumba ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I don't like it . __eou__ Really ? You must like tango , right ? __eou__ Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . __eou__ Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . __eou__ OK . I'll have a try . __eou__ Oh , you dance it so well . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . __eou__ I think I'm your lucky fellow . __eou__
Hi , Michael , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , things are all right . __eou__ I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? __eou__ Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . __eou__ Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? __eou__ She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " __eou__ Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . __eou__ I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__ Oh come on , it's not that bad . __eou__ No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . __eou__ Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . __eou__ That's the plan . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__
Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . __eou__ Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . __eou__ Are you OK today ? __eou__ Quite good except thinking of you so much . __eou__ So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . __eou__ It's called love is blind , I think . __eou__
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ Yep . And it breathes , see ! __eou__ It's not breathing ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around ! __eou__ And you'd look so cool ! __eou__
The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? __eou__ Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . __eou__ That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . __eou__ I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . __eou__ But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . __eou__
Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? __eou__ About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . __eou__ You know , about David and new boss . __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . __eou__ Well , I hear David have been fired . __eou__ Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . __eou__
Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? __eou__ Yes . What a good job we have done ! __eou__ Why are so many extra gifts left here ? __eou__ Many customers didn't want them . __eou__ How about giving them to that old man ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . __eou__ I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . __eou__ But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . __eou__ That's true . __eou__ Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__ Okay . How tiring the job is ! __eou__
Guess , what I ’ Ve bought for you . __eou__ Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ I love flowers you know . Thank you very much . __eou__ that ’ s all right . __eou__
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? __eou__ Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . __eou__ Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? __eou__ I prefer sea food . __eou__ ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . __eou__ That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__ See you later . __eou__ bye . __eou__
Cindy , I have this room to myself ? __eou__ It's all yours . __eou__ It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan ! __eou__ Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . __eou__ I think I'm going to like it here . __eou__ You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . __eou__ Wow , I have my own bathroom ! __eou__ Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . __eou__ We share the same bathroom , in other words . __eou__
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? __eou__ No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . __eou__ I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . __eou__ Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . __eou__ I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . __eou__ I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . __eou__ It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . __eou__ Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . __eou__ Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . __eou__ Why do you say " have to " ? __eou__ Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . __eou__ Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . __eou__ Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . __eou__ Do you want me to give you a ride ? __eou__ No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . __eou__ Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . __eou__ See you around . __eou__
I quit my job . __eou__ You can't be serious . __eou__
Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? __eou__ I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . __eou__ He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . __eou__ But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . __eou__
Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__
Hi , Peter . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make it to dinner tomorrow night . __eou__ Oh , why not ? __eou__ It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself . __eou__ Thanks . I will . __eou__
I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? __eou__ A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to one . __eou__ Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . __eou__ Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . __eou__ But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here . __eou__ OK , let's go . __eou__
Hi , happy new year ! __eou__ Hey , the same to you ! __eou__ Time flies ! One year has already been a history ! __eou__ Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! __eou__ Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? __eou__ Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? __eou__ I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . __eou__ That will be a good one ! Anything else ? __eou__ Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__
Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? __eou__ I enjoy camping . __eou__ Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? __eou__ I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think . __eou__ Do you hike or fish on your trips ? __eou__ Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles . __eou__ Did you catch anything ? __eou__ Yes , but I threw them back . __eou__ How about Joining our summer camp next week ? __eou__ Great ! I can't wait . __eou__
Thank you very much for your invitation . __eou__ It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown . __eou__ I'd like to say goodbye to you . __eou__ I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye ! __eou__
My brother joined the army last year . __eou__ Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? __eou__ He's tall and strong . __eou__ I can tell it from your build . __eou__
I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . __eou__ I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . __eou__ Thank you so much . You're an expert . __eou__
Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . __eou__
Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? __eou__ Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . __eou__ Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . __eou__ For sure all the customers will benefit from this . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__ Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__ Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . __eou__ Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__ Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__ Yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__ Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information __eou__
Can I use your laptop for a while ? __eou__ Sure , go ahead . __eou__ Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? __eou__ Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . __eou__ Oh my , no internet access is killing me . __eou__ Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . __eou__ No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . __eou__ Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . __eou__ What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . __eou__ Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ Then , you're probably addicted . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? __eou__ well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is . __eou__
So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ? __eou__ Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . __eou__ Did he tell you what she was like first ? __eou__ Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . __eou__
I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time . __eou__ I hope so , too.Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much . __eou__ After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now . __eou__ But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys . __eou__ I agree with you , but you know how old-fashioned the elders are . __eou__
Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . __eou__
Hey man , what do you have on tap ? __eou__ Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . __eou__ Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . __eou__ Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? __eou__ Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . __eou__ Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks . __eou__ Wait ... What ! __eou__
Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
Your father looks much younger in the picture . __eou__ He was 20 years old then . __eou__ How old is he now ? __eou__ He's over sixty . __eou__
He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . __eou__ How did he make a fortune ? __eou__ He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . __eou__ oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . __eou__ nice to meet you too . __eou__ would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . __eou__ thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? __eou__ oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . __eou__ oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__ you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants __eou__ there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__ well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__ that would be wonderful . Thanks ! __eou__
Haven't run into you for ages ! __eou__ It really is.You ' Ve changed so much . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? __eou__ Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . __eou__ Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? __eou__ In some way , she is more modern . __eou__ If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . __eou__ If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely . __eou__
Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . __eou__ Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . __eou__ Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . __eou__
Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . __eou__ But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . __eou__ That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . __eou__
Should I ask Sara to the party ? __eou__ I would if I were you . __eou__
Ann , do you have time next Monday ? __eou__ Yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . __eou__ Wow . I'd love to . __eou__ Great ! __eou__ When and where ? __eou__ Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? __eou__ Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation . __eou__ I am going to invite other guys . See you that day . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ She what ? __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ Four hundred ? __eou__ No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ Ah ... __eou__ And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ Wow . __eou__ See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . __eou__ If I survive the next six months . __eou__
Hi Amy , you look very happy . __eou__ Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . __eou__ Wow . You must be very excited . __eou__ I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . __eou__ Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? __eou__ What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . __eou__ Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . __eou__ Let ’ s go then . __eou__
How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? __eou__ How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? __eou__ He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . __eou__ Does he even know how to speak English ? __eou__ No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . __eou__ That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . __eou__ Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! __eou__ Oh , all right . Have him come over here for dinner . But you get to make dinner ! __eou__
We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . __eou__ Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
Have you bought another handset __eou__ No , it is the original one . __eou__ This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . __eou__ I have changed a case for it . __eou__ Can a handset case be changed ? __eou__ Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . __eou__ How many cases are accessible ? __eou__ There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . __eou__ It's really going to be fresh all the time . __eou__
I'm going to Ireland this summer . __eou__ Are you going to take your children along ? __eou__ No , I'd like to go alone . __eou__ Have a nice holiday ! __eou__
The show will be starting in a few minutes . We'd better go in and find our seats . __eou__ Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls , aren't they ? __eou__ That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . __eou__ What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__ Look . It's begin . __eou__ Well , how did you like the show ? __eou__ It's so interesting , I like it very much . __eou__
Henry , I want to ask you something . __eou__ Say what you want to say . __eou__ You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . __eou__ I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . __eou__
Is your father in the habit of having naps ? __eou__ Yes , all of us have naps . __eou__ Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__ No , not at all . __eou__
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . __eou__
Happy birthday , Aims ! __eou__ Thank you , Lisa . __eou__ Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you . __eou__
We have to pick up Conrad before the party . __eou__ Alright , no problem . __eou__ We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 __eou__ Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ That's a gay bar . __eou__ Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? __eou__ I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? __eou__ Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . __eou__ Why doesn't he meet us outside ? __eou__ Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . __eou__ Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? __eou__ You sound like you're afraid . __eou__ I just wouldn't be comfortable . __eou__ You've never been in a gay bar before ? __eou__ No , never . __eou__ But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? __eou__ No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . __eou__ Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . __eou__ Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . __eou__ I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__
Jill , how do you like your new job ? __eou__ I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . __eou__ I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . __eou__ Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . __eou__ Sure , I think I know the place . __eou__ Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . __eou__ That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? __eou__ Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . __eou__ Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . __eou__ No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . __eou__ Well I wish you luck . __eou__
Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! __eou__ Hi , Alex ! __eou__ Where have you been ? __eou__ I just got back from London . __eou__ How was your flight ? __eou__ It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? __eou__ It was 10 hours . __eou__ Did you have a layover ? __eou__ Yes , in Paris , France . __eou__ Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ It was nothing . __eou__
Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? __eou__ At the drop of a hat . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
Did you get the car you wanted ? __eou__ No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . __eou__ What about the car over there ? __eou__ It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . __eou__
Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . __eou__
What time is it , Tom ? __eou__ Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . __eou__ Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now . __eou__ What's the hurry ? __eou__ I must catch the nine-thirty train . __eou__ You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there . __eou__
How long have you been in China ? __eou__ A few months . __eou__ How do you think of living here ? __eou__ Great ! I'm having a great time . __eou__
Do you think Tom will be elected president ? __eou__ No , I think Harry will get it . __eou__ Let's make a bet on who gets it . __eou__ OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . __eou__
Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? __eou__ I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . __eou__ No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? __eou__ They say you shouldn't mix love and work . __eou__ That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . __eou__ You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . __eou__ People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . __eou__ That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . __eou__ If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . __eou__ You are sounding like we are already married . __eou__ Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . __eou__ Well , I don't feel right about it . __eou__ I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . __eou__ Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? __eou__ I like company . __eou__ Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! __eou__ What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . __eou__ Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . __eou__ You want to go out with me and you know it . __eou__ In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . __eou__ Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? __eou__
Dave , wake up . __eou__ Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? __eou__ It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk . __eou__ What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter . __eou__ It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . __eou__ And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? __eou__ It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . __eou__
Did you like the party ? __eou__ Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . __eou__ Why ? What had you expected ? __eou__ I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . __eou__
Hello , Tom ! __eou__ Hello , Steven ! __eou__ How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . What about you ? __eou__ I'm just a little tired . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . __eou__ How is your family ? __eou__ Pretty fine , thanks . __eou__ Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . __eou__ OK , see you next time . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Who got ripped off ? __eou__ Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? __eou__ Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . __eou__ Now we're getting to the truth . __eou__ There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . __eou__ See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . __eou__
He has a girlfriend already . __eou__ You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . __eou__ His new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . __eou__ I hope I will meet her soon . __eou__
I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . __eou__ Really ? That's nice . __eou__ He usually keeps me posted . __eou__ I've been completely out of touch with my old friends . __eou__ It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . __eou__ Yes , people just seem to drift apart . __eou__
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just watching some television . __eou__ I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . __eou__ Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? __eou__ I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . __eou__ That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? __eou__ That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . __eou__ I like to play the piano for fun . __eou__ Yeah . That can be a good hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . __eou__ That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? __eou__ why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Bill . __eou__ Merry Christmas , Jina . __eou__ What are you doing there on the computer ? __eou__ Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends . __eou__ That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . __eou__ Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ? __eou__ Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . __eou__ No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days . __eou__ Thanks million . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
You were right . It's raining again . __eou__ I told you so . __eou__
have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? __eou__ sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . __eou__ but you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch __eou__ yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i __eou__ anything strang about that ? __eou__ maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__ oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . __eou__
It's very dark in here.Will you turn on the light ? __eou__ Okay.But our baby has fallen sleep . __eou__ Then , turn on the lamp , please . __eou__ But where's the switch ? __eou__ It's there by the window . __eou__
Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? __eou__ The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . __eou__ Which city did you like better ? __eou__ That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . __eou__ And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? __eou__ Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting . __eou__ Which one has better nightlife ? __eou__ Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada . __eou__ Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . __eou__
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? __eou__ Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . __eou__ I guess I need all of them . __eou__ Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__ I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__ Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . __eou__
Good afternoon , would you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ Of course not . __eou__ I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? __eou__ Laura . __eou__ Do you like this place ? __eou__ I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . __eou__ How often ? __eou__ Well , we come here almost every month . __eou__ Who ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . __eou__ Do you like swimming ? __eou__ No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . __eou__
Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I don't know yet . __eou__ I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . __eou__ Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . __eou__ Or what only we are able to give them . __eou__
Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought . __eou__ But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets . __eou__ That's not the gadgets.Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . __eou__
That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . __eou__ Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? __eou__ You can say that again ! __eou__ What's up with Vince and Elvin ? __eou__ They work for Zina now . __eou__ And they're happy with that ? __eou__ They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . __eou__
Good evening , sir , and welcome to Chez Attitude . __eou__ We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Foster , if you would please be seated over in the waiting area , our hostess will be with you in a moment . __eou__ Thank you . Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ? __eou__ Of course , I will tell her . __eou__ I would really prefer an outside table .

Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__
What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? __eou__ Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . __eou__ I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . __eou__ Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . __eou__ The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . __eou__

Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? __eou__ You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary .

But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? __eou__ Darned right I would ! __eou__ Maybe make-up would be enough ? __eou__ Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy .

Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__ But I find Japanese ones better . __eou__

It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . __eou__ yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... __eou__ is everything ready now ? __eou__ almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ my pleasure . __eou__

The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once .

Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? __eou__ Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? __eou__ They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? __eou__ For me , I think starting school was more exciting . __eou__ Does that mean work isn't that great ? __eou__ It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . __eou__ But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . __eou__ That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . __eou__ I hope you're right . __eou__

He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
Why did Tom quit the job ? __eou__ He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . __eou__ If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . __eou__
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__

I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . __eou__ Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? __eou__ Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__ Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__ Mrs . Thou ? __eou__ Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ Great .

Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? __eou__
Why is the long face ? __eou__ I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . __eou__ Did you just get your review or something ? __eou__ Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . __eou__ That sucks . __eou__ I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . __eou__ Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . __eou__ Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . __eou__ Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . __eou__ How about a cold bottle of beer . __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
You're going to Shanghai tomorrow , are you ? __eou__ That's right . Do you think it'll be cold ? __eou__ It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . __eou__ Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? __eou__ Not for now , I think , But I believe there'll be rain , so take your raincoat with you . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy ! __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert with me ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? __eou__ We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ That sounds very general . __eou__ It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? __eou__ Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . __eou__ We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__
How's business ? __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
So Emily , what do you like to do for fun ? __eou__ I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ? __eou__ I also like going to the movies . __eou__ Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! __eou__
Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . __eou__ I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? __eou__ Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . __eou__ Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? __eou__ He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . __eou__ He looks like a very personable man . __eou__ He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . __eou__
Well , how was your honeymoon ? __eou__ It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . __eou__ Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! __eou__ Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? __eou__ My friends and I just got back from Bali . __eou__ Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? __eou__ Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . __eou__ Did you go diving while you were there ? __eou__ I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! __eou__ Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? __eou__ I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . __eou__ Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? __eou__ We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? __eou__ No , but I do like snowboarding . __eou__ Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? __eou__ I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! __eou__ It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . __eou__
I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . __eou__ I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! __eou__ How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . __eou__ You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__
How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? __eou__ Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . __eou__ You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? __eou__ I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . __eou__ Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? __eou__ I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . __eou__ How's your current job going ? __eou__ I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . __eou__

Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ It's George . __eou__ Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . __eou__
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse __eou__ what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ I see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ they're related to one another , yes . __eou__ I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__

Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . __eou__ He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round .

That's the tradition ? __eou__ Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . __eou__ I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . __eou__ You should be there some Christmas Eve . __eou__

That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . __eou__ Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . __eou__ I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . __eou__ Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . __eou__ Such as ? __eou__ They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . __eou__ They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . __eou__ Right !

I'm fond of piano , you know . __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid . __eou__ That ’ s understandable . Every kid likes new clothes . __eou__ It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . __eou__

I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__
I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack . __eou__ You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . __eou__ But his daughter is a very nice girl . __eou__
Good morning , you look very tired . __eou__ Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . __eou__ Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? __eou__ No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . __eou__ I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . __eou__ The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . __eou__ Do you have much time watching TV ? __eou__ I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . __eou__ I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . __eou__ If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . __eou__
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall we do ? __eou__ Call the police . __eou__
I cannot stay here any more minutes . __eou__ What is wrong with you ? __eou__ Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . __eou__ You can talk with him . __eou__
Hi , what ’ re you reading ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? __eou__ No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished . __eou__ Sure . I didn ’ t know you liked mysteries . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . __eou__
Are you OK ? __eou__ Yeah . Why not ? __eou__ Because ... I heard John got married yesterday . __eou__ Oh , you went to the wedding ? __eou__ No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad . __eou__ I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time . __eou__
How did your interview go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ Will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ My boss . __eou__ What kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ Those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ What do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do . __eou__
Well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! __eou__ Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! __eou__
I think he won't remember White Day . __eou__ Silly , you should make sure he does . __eou__ Uh-huh . How about you ? __eou__ He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . __eou__ You got a big return for a small gift . __eou__
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? __eou__ Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . __eou__ I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . __eou__
What happened to your brother ? __eou__ It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . __eou__ Your parents must be worrying about him . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . __eou__ Have you talked to him ? __eou__ Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen . __eou__
How do you like the play ? __eou__ It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__ Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . __eou__ Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . __eou__ Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . __eou__ Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another . __eou__
So how long have you know Jack ? __eou__ We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . __eou__ Really ? You guys must be really tight . __eou__ Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . __eou__ He seems sincere , and trustworthy . __eou__ Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . __eou__ Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . __eou__ Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . __eou__ So , can I trust him or what ? __eou__ Well , I think you should decide for yourself . __eou__ But I need someone that I can count on for this job . __eou__ Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . __eou__ Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . __eou__ Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . __eou__
It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . __eou__ Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time . __eou__ OK . __eou__

How's your new job going ? __eou__ Really well , thanks . __eou__ How are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ How about your new co-workers ? __eou__ They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ Do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ Do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ Do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . __eou__ I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . __eou__ No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . __eou__ I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . __eou__

My watch has stopped . __eou__ It ’ s half past twelve . __eou__ When do you have lunch ? __eou__ From one to two . __eou__ What do you normally eat ? __eou__ We usually go to the cafeteria . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . __eou__ let ’ s go together . __eou__
I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? __eou__ So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . __eou__ What part of the film do you like best ? __eou__ Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . __eou__ I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . __eou__ Actually , tears also came to my eyes . __eou__ It has got this year's Oscar Award . __eou__ It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . __eou__
I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . __eou__ What airline and what flight ? __eou__ Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . __eou__ I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . __eou__ Ok . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . __eou__ What was wrong ? __eou__ You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . __eou__ I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . __eou__ I know , I know . But someone took offence . __eou__
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . __eou__ Who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . __eou__ Do they have a good team ? __eou__ I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . __eou__ You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ How many more games are there this season ? __eou__ We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . __eou__
How do you like my new sports car ? __eou__ It's cool . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . __eou__
Are you a blogger ? __eou__ Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__ Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? __eou__ I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . __eou__ What do you usually write about ? __eou__ At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . __eou__ That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? __eou__ It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__ Got it . Are you still updating your blog ? __eou__ Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . __eou__ Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . __eou__
Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison __eou__ Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre __eou__ Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents __eou__ Please come in __eou__ But you're busy , aren't you ? __eou__ I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . __eou__ I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? __eou__ Oh ! yes __eou__
Merry Christmas , Lily . __eou__ The same to you , Joey . __eou__ This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . __eou__ It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . __eou__
Where's Tom this evening ? __eou__ He's a little sick under the weather . __eou__ Really ! What's the matter with him ? __eou__ He has the flu . __eou__ Tell him I was asking about him . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
Shall we have two tickets for for seven thirty ? __eou__ Yes , Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back ? __eou__ In the front , please . __eou__
What are your plans for this weekend ? __eou__ I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . __eou__ If the weather's fine . __eou__ I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . __eou__ I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . __eou__ Thanks . That would be really helpful . __eou__ But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous . __eou__
How do you celebrate national day in your country ? __eou__ There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . __eou__ What kinds of parades are there ? __eou__ The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? __eou__ We don ’ t have a national day . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s unusual . __eou__ I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . __eou__ Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . __eou__
Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy . __eou__ You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company . __eou__ Oh , congratulations ! __eou__
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . __eou__ No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . __eou__
Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? __eou__ To the cinema . What about coming with me ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . __eou__ What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . __eou__ Do you go to the cinema a lot ? __eou__ Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly __eou__ Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? __eou__ No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? __eou__ I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . __eou__ Oh , does she ? That's convenient . __eou__ Yes , but I want to go to the country . __eou__ Don't you like the sea ? __eou__ Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? __eou__ I'm going to stay at home . __eou__ Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? __eou__ No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . __eou__
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know . __eou__
hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a __eou__ it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h __eou__ well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
Bob is really disturbed these days . __eou__ We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him . __eou__ But we cannot talk like elders . __eou__ Of course not . Let's talk to him in a very friendly way . __eou__
Good afternoon , Johnson . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? __eou__ Not bad , thanks . __eou__
Jack , what do you think about the election ? __eou__ I think the campaign is a blockbuster . __eou__ How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? __eou__ Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . __eou__ Who do you think will be elected ? __eou__ It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . __eou__ I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . __eou__ Maybe . Who knows ? __eou__
Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? __eou__ Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? __eou__ The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? __eou__ My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . __eou__ Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . __eou__ Why do you always accuse me like that ? __eou__ Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . __eou__ Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world ! __eou__ Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love . __eou__
At last ! The weekend comes again ! __eou__ Yes . What will you do these two days ? __eou__ After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . __eou__ But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . __eou__
Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh , I can't . I have a date ! __eou__ Really ? Wow with who ? __eou__ This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . __eou__ Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? __eou__ Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . __eou__ That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? __eou__ It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . __eou__ I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! __eou__
What a brilliant smile ! __eou__ That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling . __eou__ He must be very easy-going . __eou__ Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . __eou__
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of door . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is . t does work . __eou__
You're from New York , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ What do you suggest I should see in New York ? __eou__ Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? __eou__ No , I don't like museums . They're boring . __eou__ Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? __eou__ Ah ! That sounds interesting . __eou__
Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . __eou__ For what reason . __eou__ Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . __eou__ He had better make a change . __eou__
How can I live without Helen ? __eou__ Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . __eou__
Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? __eou__ Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ Well , Rose . __eou__ Is there something any need ? __eou__ Are your free this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I have nothing to do . __eou__ Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? __eou__ Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . __eou__ OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__ I'll be there on time . __eou__
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Beautiful . __eou__ You are not English , are you ? __eou__ No , I am from France . __eou__
What was the last movie you saw ? __eou__ A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ Really ? I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ I guess it could happen . __eou__
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
Happy New Year , Rose . __eou__ Happy New Year , Thomas . How many joys nice drinks with us , will you ? __eou__ Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ? __eou__ First , I am going to get ready for the parade , I have a great costume . Then later today , I am going to church . If you want , I can give you a costume , and you can be at parade too . It will be fun __eou__ Sure , why not . Sounds like fun . Why are you going to church ? __eou__ My father likes to go , and I told him I will go with him . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ Lots of people especially seniors like to go to church , and attend the evening service . __eou__
Going to the cafeteria ? __eou__ No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? __eou__ That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . __eou__ Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . __eou__
Do you like climbing ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . __eou__ Have you visited it before ? __eou__ Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . __eou__ Sounds marvelous . __eou__ You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . __eou__ Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . __eou__
Are you free tomorrow night ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Shall we have dinner together ? __eou__ Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . __eou__ OK . I'll be happy to join you . __eou__
The city has got a traffic problem . __eou__ That means it's developing very fast . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ Problems are inevitable . __eou__
Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? __eou__ Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . __eou__ Brad Bush ? Good for you ! __eou__ But I don't know what to do . __eou__ You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? __eou__ My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . __eou__ Until college ? __eou__ Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! __eou__ Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . __eou__ Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . __eou__ You're like the tenth person to say that . __eou__ We're just worried about you , Taylor . __eou__ Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! __eou__
Why don't you watch where you're going ? __eou__ Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! __eou__ There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . __eou__ Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . __eou__ I think my arm is broken . __eou__ Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . __eou__ Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . __eou__ Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . __eou__ I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? __eou__ Alright . __eou__ It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . __eou__ Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__ Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__ It really hurts . __eou__ Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? __eou__ To hell with you . The accident was your fault . __eou__ I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? __eou__ To hell with you . __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ Yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__
I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? __eou__ That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? __eou__ I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot . __eou__ You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . __eou__ Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day ! __eou__ Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? __eou__ Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner ! __eou__ Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . __eou__ Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? __eou__ No ... __eou__ Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? __eou__ That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! __eou__ You really have a bid head , don't you ! __eou__
If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . __eou__ You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . __eou__ Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . __eou__
Julia , will you be my wife ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Steven . __eou__ Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . __eou__ I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . __eou__ Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . __eou__ Your way does touch my heart . __eou__ So , will you marry me ? __eou__ I want to think of it for some time . __eou__
I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . __eou__ At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . __eou__ Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... __eou__ Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . __eou__ No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . __eou__ No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . __eou__
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? __eou__ I just took a shot in the dark . __eou__
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? __eou__ Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . __eou__
May , look , what's that in the cage ? __eou__ Don't you know that ? It's panda . __eou__ Of course I know . I just can't see it very well . __eou__ OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? __eou__ Of course , Bamboo ! __eou__ That's right . __eou__ I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . __eou__ You sound quite knowledgeable . __eou__ Not really , panda is my favorite animal . __eou__ Actually , it likes milk too . __eou__ Any way , in a word , panda is our friend . __eou__ Do you know other famous animals in the world ? __eou__ Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . __eou__ That's right . OK , let's move on . __eou__
What is today ? __eou__ Thursday . __eou__ So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
Do you like chocolates ? __eou__ It depends . __eou__ Do you like coffee ? __eou__ Um . It ’ s delicious . __eou__ And do you like English food ? __eou__ Not all of it . __eou__
Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . __eou__ What kind of business do you do ? __eou__ We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . __eou__ What kind of clients do you prefer ? __eou__ Smaller local companies .

Hi , Jenny . Are still working ? __eou__ Hi , Nancy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . __eou__ So , you are leaving , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m going to take a holiday tomorrow . __eou__ How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__ That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? __eou__ Yes , could you please go over this for me ?

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday . __eou__ This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it . __eou__ Why ? Do you know that guy ? __eou__ No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . __eou__ That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . __eou__ No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . __eou__ Wow . That's wonderful . __eou__ What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? __eou__ Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . __eou__
Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ Yes , it is lovely .

Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day . __eou__ You forgot all about it , didn't you ? __eou__

It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . __eou__ Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . __eou__ Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . __eou__ Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . __eou__ Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . __eou__ Yes . Will it hurt us ? __eou__ I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . __eou__ I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__ You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__ Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__
I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__
OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! __eou__ Why ? Are they good ? __eou__ They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! __eou__ I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! __eou__ Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... __eou__ Ummmph ! __eou__
I think I'm going to go home . __eou__ Why ? We just got here . __eou__ I know , but it's 12 __eou__ 12 __eou__ Three or four o'clock ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I never stay out that late . That's too late . __eou__ But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? __eou__ Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? __eou__ Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . __eou__ What is that they're doing on the couch ? __eou__ They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . __eou__ Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? __eou__ I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . __eou__ I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . __eou__ You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . __eou__ I thought a university was for studying . __eou__ It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . __eou__ Alright . I'll have another drink . __eou__
Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . __eou__ Were you celebrating something ? __eou__ Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . __eou__ I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . __eou__ Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? __eou__ Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . __eou__ Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . __eou__ Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... __eou__ ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . __eou__ Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . __eou__ Shift it a little before you get up . __eou__ And I need to stretch my legs now . __eou__
What would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ? __eou__ Bread . __eou__ And milk or orange juice ? __eou__ Orange juice . __eou__ What would you like for lunch , pork , mutton or beef ? __eou__ I think mutton is best . __eou__ What kind of drink do you like most , red wine , beer or champagne ? __eou__ I like champagne . __eou__ And among apples , oranges and bananas , which is your favorite ? __eou__ Banana of course . __eou__ Do you always have meals outside or in your house ? __eou__ I always have meals outside , because I ’ m not good at cooking . __eou__
It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... __eou__ Miss ! __eou__ Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... __eou__ My name is Jane Brown ! __eou__ Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . __eou__

I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? __eou__ He has been keeping bach after divorce . __eou__ He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . __eou__ Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . __eou__
It seems a glorious day today . __eou__ I agree ... __eou__ It's beginning to spot . __eou__ Just now we both thought it would be fine . __eou__
Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . __eou__ I ’ Ve been playing computer games . __eou__ What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? __eou__ It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__ You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__ My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__ Fine ! __eou__ Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . __eou__ Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! __eou__
Why didn't you go to school yesterday ? __eou__ I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . __eou__ What was your problem ? __eou__ My stomach was bothering me . __eou__ Are you feeling any better ? __eou__ I'm still feeling a little sick . __eou__ I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? __eou__ I'd appreciate that . __eou__
That was heaven ! __eou__ The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . __eou__ Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! __eou__
I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . __eou__
What is life ? __eou__ Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart . __eou__ Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us . __eou__ Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ? __eou__ Right . __eou__
Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? __eou__ OK . When ? __eou__ At 10 o'clock . __eou__ 10 in the morning ? __eou__ No , at night . __eou__ Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM . __eou__ OK , how about 1:30 PM ? __eou__ No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then . __eou__ How about 5:00 PM ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ OK , see you then . __eou__ Alright . Bye . __eou__

I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . __eou__ I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . __eou__ Thank you so much . You're an expert . __eou__
It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I got my father ’ s goat last night . __eou__ What did you do to get his goat ? __eou__ When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . __eou__
Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ? __eou__ Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ You bet . You should try it yourself . __eou__
I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
Well , I guess that ’ s about it . Everything ’ s packed and ready to go . __eou__ It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ? __eou__ Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . __eou__ Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are . __eou__
Julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . __eou__
do you like animals ? I really like dogs . __eou__ so do i . I don ’ t like cats . __eou__ why ? I think cats are ok . __eou__ I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . __eou__ I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__ I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__ I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__ really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . __eou__
Who broke the glass , Peter ? __eou__ That cat . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . __eou__ It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . __eou__
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ that depends . What is it ? __eou__ it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans __eou__ I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . __eou__ let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__ how about at 6 pm ? __eou__ see you then ! __eou__

Are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . __eou__ What research ? __eou__ Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? __eou__ But they're just ads . __eou__ Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends . __eou__
How ’ s your father ? __eou__ He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__ How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ In the same way , probably . __eou__
I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . __eou__ Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! __eou__ That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . __eou__ Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . __eou__

our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__ well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b __eou__

How was your holiday to Cyprus ? __eou__ It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home . __eou__ Did you happen to meet someone ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ? __eou__ His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there . __eou__ Was it love at first sight ? __eou__ Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . __eou__ And ? __eou__ Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . __eou__ That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ? __eou__ Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . __eou__ It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen . __eou__
Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . __eou__ Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . __eou__ Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . __eou__ But he still does not come back . __eou__ Maybe he is on the way home now . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ So many ? __eou__ This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . __eou__ Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? __eou__ Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__
How did you first meet Jack each other ? __eou__ That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' __eou__ Then he sent you to your home ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . __eou__ He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . __eou__ He is so humorous . __eou__
Who's that striking woman over there ? __eou__ Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? She looks great . __eou__ Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . __eou__ Really ? Tell me more . __eou__ Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . __eou__ Wow , crikey . So what happened ? __eou__ Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . __eou__ Wow . __eou__ Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? __eou__ I have no idea what you're talking about . __eou__ Oh , come on . Everybody knows . __eou__ Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ yes , I am the guy ... __eou__ what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__
I really love this meal . __eou__ Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . __eou__ Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? __eou__ I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . __eou__ The chicken is out of this world ! __eou__ I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . __eou__ I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . __eou__ Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__ It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . __eou__ I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . __eou__
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I have to work overtime . __eou__ You are really career minded . __eou__ My boss promised to pay me double time . __eou__

We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival . __eou__ When is it ? __eou__ It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . __eou__ Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? __eou__ OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . __eou__ Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? __eou__ In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body . __eou__ It sounds so moving . __eou__
You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . __eou__ If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . __eou__ I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . __eou__ I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . __eou__ Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
Have you seen any good movies lately ? __eou__ It's ages since I went to see a film . __eou__ Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . __eou__ But now I would stay at home watching TV . __eou__
Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate . __eou__ Thanks , Miss . Wang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . __eou__
Do you like singing ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Let's go to a ETV tonight . __eou__ But I can't sing it well . __eou__ It doesn't matter . No one will laugh at you . __eou__ OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ? __eou__ What about six ? __eou__ It's too early . Let's make it seven , OK ? __eou__ OK . Let's make it . __eou__

The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . __eou__ This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? __eou__ Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything __eou__ No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . __eou__ Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . __eou__ Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . __eou__ I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? __eou__ I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . __eou__ They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos .

I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now .

Honey , would you marry me ? __eou__ I want to think about it for some time . __eou__ Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . __eou__ I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart . __eou__ Oh , god , please tell me how . __eou__ I can't tell you . __eou__ OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you . __eou__ When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ? __eou__ Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life . __eou__ Don't be so happy , it is just one of my tests ! __eou__

Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? __eou__ Well , do you think I have to ? __eou__ I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . __eou__ Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday ? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . __eou__ How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . __eou__ OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . __eou__

Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? __eou__ Jake just broke up with me . __eou__ I'm sorry . When did this happen ? __eou__ Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . __eou__ What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . __eou__ But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . __eou__ He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . __eou__ Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him __eou__ It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . __eou__ I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . __eou__ Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . __eou__ Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . __eou__ How about coffee down the street ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? __eou__ I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before . __eou__ Do you usually shower or take a bath ? __eou__ I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . __eou__ Do you shave every morning ? __eou__ I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere . If I ’ m staying at home , I don ’ t shave . __eou__ Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ? __eou__ Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed . __eou__ Your dentist must be proud of you ! __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__ Come on ! It is really a fun game . __eou__
Has the game started yet ? __eou__ Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . __eou__ Who's winning ? __eou__ The Bulls , of course ! __eou__ What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! __eou__ Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . __eou__ You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! __eou__ That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! __eou__ Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! __eou__ This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! __eou__ Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . __eou__
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? __eou__ No , it's the Japanese team . __eou__ Japanese teams always play a dark horse . __eou__ Well , their team work is well worth learning . __eou__

I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . __eou__ I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . __eou__ I am going there , too . We can walk together . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ? __eou__ It depends on the weather . __eou__ The radio says it'll be fine . __eou__ That'll be great . __eou__
It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . __eou__ Please sit down and make yourself at home .

Are you free on Thursday afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant . __eou__ Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ? __eou__ That's fine . See you there ! __eou__
I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow . __eou__ I know . It's going to be so much fun . __eou__ I always get excited the day before . __eou__ I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . __eou__ I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . __eou__ That makes sense . __eou__ What things make you excited ? __eou__ Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited . __eou__ Oh ... that makes me excited too ! __eou__ Looks like anything fun makes you excited . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__
Who's the woman you talked to just now ? __eou__ She's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year . __eou__ Oh , no wonder you're so respectful to her . __eou__
The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . __eou__ Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? __eou__ Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . __eou__ Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . __eou__ You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . __eou__
Have a nice weekend ! __eou__ Thanks.You too ! __eou__ Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . __eou__
It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! __eou__ I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__ I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . __eou__ Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . __eou__ Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! __eou__
What's the score ? __eou__ The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . __eou__ The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . __eou__ It doesn't seem to be so easy . __eou__
What is the correct time , please ? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ When will the lecture begin ? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . __eou__
Can you lend me your car ? __eou__ Nothing ' doing . __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ I haven ’ t seen you for several days . __eou__ Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . __eou__ What ’ s he doing ? __eou__ He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . __eou__ He must be happy . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine too . __eou__
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . __eou__ Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . __eou__
This is great , isn't it ? __eou__ It's the most fun I've had in years . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Yes , we should . __eou__
Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__
Peter , how often do you exercise ? __eou__ Well , I swim and run every day . __eou__ Now , tell me , what do you eat ? __eou__ Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . __eou__ Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? __eou__ Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__ Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . __eou__
I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on . __eou__ Don ’ t be fool . I ’ ll always side with you . __eou__ I appreciate your kindness . __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
hi , Meally , do you know that guy over there ? __eou__ The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . __eou__ He is cute . What dose he do ? __eou__ I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . __eou__ Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__

And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? __eou__ Of course !

I don't like horror movies . __eou__ How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ __eou__ No . I heard that's really boring . __eou__ Why don't we go to a concert instead ? __eou__ Great idea ! __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
who are you writing a letter to ? __eou__ I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? __eou__ OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . __eou__ that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? __eou__ well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . __eou__ you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__ just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__ congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__ shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__ ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . __eou__ I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! I almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! __eou__

You're good at language . __eou__ That's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice . __eou__

Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ Please come in , Mr.Jackson . __eou__ No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . __eou__
What day is it ? __eou__ It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? __eou__ I'm leaving on November 10th . __eou__ Isn't it a Sunday ? __eou__ No , it's a Monday . __eou__ So you are leaving two weeks from now ? __eou__ Right . __eou__
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__ that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__ oh , why ? __eou__ I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__ I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__ well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? __eou__ I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . __eou__ or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__ a left girl ? What's that ? __eou__ they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , __eou__ you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__ that ' for sure but very few . __eou__
What are you up to tonight , Steve ? __eou__ I'm going to a disco with my friends . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Have a good time . __eou__
Happy Birthday , Mary ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? __eou__ I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother . __eou__ Really ? It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you , Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary . __eou__ It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality . __eou__
Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm fine . How about yourself ? __eou__ I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . __eou__ No problem . So how have you been ? __eou__ I've been great .

It's a really big campus . __eou__ Good luck with school . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
How did you first meet ? __eou__ My roommate invited both of us to dinner . __eou__ Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? __eou__ Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . __eou__
Joe , how are you doing ? __eou__ Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? __eou__ I am free that night , and a party sounds good . __eou__ Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? __eou__ I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? __eou__ I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK . __eou__ Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . __eou__ Would you like some help with the food ? __eou__ Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink . __eou__
Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ? __eou__ Just last week . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time . __eou__ Well , tell me . What are they like ? __eou__ They ’ re nice . __eou__
What happened to you yesterday ? __eou__ Oh I fell over on the way to work . __eou__ Oh I see . So that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? __eou__ Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn ’ t call you . __eou__ Oh dear , that sounds terrible . __eou__ It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . __eou__ Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . __eou__
Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . __eou__ Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . __eou__ Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . __eou__ I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . __eou__ Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . __eou__ That's my favorite . __eou__ You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! __eou__ It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . __eou__ Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . __eou__ All in all , it will never lose its appeal . __eou__ Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? __eou__ Sure . Now you are talking . __eou__
Mom , I've got something to tell you . __eou__ So , please ! __eou__ Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs . __eou__ I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ? __eou__ It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine . __eou__ Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you . __eou__ Nothing of that sort ! __eou__ Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long . __eou__ Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . __eou__ Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ? __eou__ Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
How are your wedding plans going ? __eou__ Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . __eou__ When will your wedding take place ? __eou__ At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . __eou__ It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? __eou__ Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . __eou__ You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ The Palace Hotel . __eou__ It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . __eou__ I think you made the right decision . __eou__
You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . __eou__ Tim , please . Please be seated . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years ready for change ? __eou__ Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . __eou__
I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like orchestra seats ? __eou__ Isn't there anything less expensive ? __eou__ Not unless you want the matinee . __eou__
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? __eou__ I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... __eou__
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . __eou__ Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? __eou__ Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! __eou__ Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? __eou__ I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . __eou__ Wow , that's really old . __eou__ Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__ Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__ I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . __eou__ Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__ Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . __eou__ Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__ Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . __eou__
Hey Nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? __eou__ Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . __eou__ Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you __eou__ Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? __eou__ Let ’ s do it ! __eou__
What does your sister look like , Mike ? __eou__ Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . __eou__ Is she like you ? __eou__ I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . __eou__ Is she as clever as you ? __eou__ No , she ’ s not as clever as me . __eou__ Big head ! __eou__
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . __eou__
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Please sit down . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__ Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ Yes , I Went there once last summer . __eou__ Really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ Was it that crowded ? __eou__ Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ Thank you very much ! __eou__
What is your hobby ? __eou__ I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . __eou__ What kind of reading materials do you like best ? __eou__ I am interested in science fiction . __eou__
We seem to be lost here . __eou__ Possibly . __eou__ I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . __eou__ Not a bit . __eou__
I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . __eou__ Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? __eou__ No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . __eou__ Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? __eou__ The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . __eou__ Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? __eou__ They name it after the place where it was first held . __eou__ Who started the modern Olympics ? __eou__ This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . __eou__ What did people call him ? __eou__ Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . __eou__ What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? __eou__ He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . __eou__ Well , that's for all . Excellent ! __eou__ I've told you I'm an expert . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use to you . __eou__ I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
Julia , are you free tonight ? __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I want to invite you to go to the movies . __eou__ Are you asking me for a date ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . __eou__ Where do you want to meet ? __eou__ Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there . __eou__ What time should we meet ? __eou__ How about seven ? __eou__ All right . __eou__
What does she do ? __eou__ She works as a teller in a bank . __eou__ Does she go to night school ? __eou__ Yes . She goes three times a week . __eou__ Why ? What does she want to be ? __eou__ She wants to be a manager . __eou__ What classes does she take ? __eou__ She takes classes in accounting and business . __eou__
I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love . __eou__ Very romantic ? __eou__ Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . __eou__ You married him for that reason ? __eou__ Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__ So shall we have lunch together ?

Can we make it another time ? __eou__ Sure , thanks . __eou__ I ’ ll call you later . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Do you know much about computers ? __eou__ Not a great deal . __eou__ I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . __eou__ I won't do it again . Please forgive me . __eou__ No way . I've given you too many chances already . __eou__
Did Roll win the race ? __eou__ Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . __eou__ But anyway , he won at last . __eou__ Yeah . To win is the most important thing . __eou__
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? __eou__ On and off , for quite a few years . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Wu ! Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Certainly . You are more welcome to do . What is it ? __eou__ Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . We both love spicy Chinese dishes . I am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where I can find some good spicy dishes . __eou__ Well , if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for , In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go . The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes . You might want to try there . __eou__ How far is it from here ? __eou__ It is near the university . Five minutes ' walk from your flat , I think . __eou__ Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . May you have a good time . Please give my regards to your wife . I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow . __eou__ Thank you . The same to you . __eou__
How many people are in your family ? __eou__ As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? __eou__ I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? __eou__ Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? __eou__ My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? __eou__ No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? __eou__ I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . __eou__ How long have you been married ? __eou__ About seven years now . and you ? __eou__ I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? __eou__ It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? __eou__ If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . __eou__ If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__ ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__
Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? __eou__ There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas . __eou__ We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ? __eou__ No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits . __eou__ There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small . __eou__ When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . __eou__ That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . __eou__ You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . __eou__ It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . __eou__ I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . __eou__ Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? __eou__ We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . __eou__
It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . __eou__ Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ What other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ Do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ Is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . __eou__
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? __eou__ I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . __eou__ Why do you like old styles of dance ? __eou__ Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? __eou__ I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . __eou__ OK , I will.Thank you . __eou__
All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! __eou__ Over my dead body you are ! __eou__
Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? __eou__ No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . __eou__ Where do they go ? __eou__ Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid __eou__ They go to the home of the bride ? __eou__ Why do you ask ? __eou__ The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . __eou__ Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . __eou__ That's very expensive for the family of the bride . __eou__ Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . __eou__ Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? __eou__ Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . __eou__ Maybe I'll be the one . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you doing anything special ? __eou__ We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on , alright ? __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . __eou__ Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? __eou__ The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . __eou__ So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . __eou__ Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . __eou__
When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . __eou__ But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . __eou__ And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . __eou__ How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . __eou__
I am so busy today . __eou__ Can I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . __eou__ I ’ ll be glad to help . __eou__ Or maybe make the beds . __eou__ All you have to do is ask for help . __eou__ Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! __eou__ I ’ m ready and willing to help . __eou__
Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? __eou__ No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . __eou__ You were born in the year of the monkey ? __eou__ Yeah , are you surprised ? __eou__ Not at all ! That explains everything ! __eou__
is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . please sit down . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__ yes , on a business trip . How about you ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ yes , I went there once last summer . __eou__ really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ was it that crowded ? __eou__ yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ thank you very much ! __eou__
What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . __eou__ Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ Ok , see you . __eou__
Did you move into your new apartment ? __eou__ Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . __eou__ Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . __eou__ I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . __eou__ Is there a supermarket nearby ? __eou__ Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . __eou__ Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . __eou__ That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how do I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! __eou__ Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . __eou__ ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy . __eou__ That's rock and roll with fast tempo . __eou__ I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz . __eou__ Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party . __eou__ Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage . __eou__ OK , follow me . __eou__ Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles . __eou__ May I ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully ! __eou__
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Oh , hey ... __eou__ What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? __eou__ Actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__ Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? __eou__ You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? __eou__ Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . __eou__
Bye , mom ! __eou__ Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! __eou__ OK . Bye ! __eou__ No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . __eou__ Alright . See ya ! __eou__ Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . __eou__ Ok , see you after school ... __eou__ Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . __eou__ Mom ? __eou__ Yes , honey ... __eou__ I ... I can ’ t breathe . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
Hi , how is it going ? __eou__ Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__ Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though . __eou__
Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got back this morning . __eou__ That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? __eou__ Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . __eou__ Did you take any pictures ? __eou__ Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? __eou__ Sure , I love looking at photos . __eou__ This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . __eou__ Your daughter looks like her mother . __eou__ I know , they look very similar . __eou__ Where was this picture taken ? __eou__ That was taken at the train station before we left . __eou__ Did you have time to go to the zoo ? __eou__ No , not this time . We went there last time . __eou__ It looks like you all had a nice time . __eou__ Yeah , it was a lot of fun . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . __eou__ Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . __eou__ You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . __eou__ How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Nothing really . __eou__ I'm throwing a party on Friday . __eou__ I didn't realize that . __eou__ You didn't ? __eou__ Nobody has told me anything about your party . __eou__ Did you want to go ? __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ At 8 __eou__ I'll be there . __eou__ I'd better see you there . __eou__ Of course . __eou__
What dressing would you like on the salad ? __eou__ French dressing , please . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ Oh , French dressing . __eou__ Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ? __eou__ We still prefer French dressing . __eou__ Will you say it again ? __eou__ Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? __eou__
I think we should accept his plan . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't agree with you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Simply because it's not practical at all . __eou__
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher . __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way . __eou__
A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . __eou__ That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . __eou__ He must be regretting about having done the business . __eou__ I bet he is . He domed his own life . __eou__
He was hauled up last week for the second time . __eou__ You mean he had been put in prison before . __eou__ Of course , he is a man with a history . __eou__ Oh , he had fooled me . __eou__
Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . __eou__ Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ Come over and visit when you have time . __eou__ Thanks for the invitation . I will ! __eou__

The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? __eou__ Johnson ? I can't place them . __eou__ We met them in Bermuda last May . __eou__ They've completely slipped my mind . __eou__ The couple with the dogs-think back . __eou__ No , I don't recall a thing about them . __eou__ Well , I've invited them for brunch . __eou__ Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . __eou__
I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party . __eou__ I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it . __eou__ I had a wonderful time . __eou__
Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . __eou__ I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . __eou__ And do you really love her ? __eou__ I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . __eou__
so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b __eou__ that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help __eou__ so , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with is ? __eou__ she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year __eou__
so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ that's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ no . did you ? __eou__ yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! __eou__
Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? __eou__ Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . __eou__ Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . __eou__ OK . Then tell me what else you know . __eou__ Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? __eou__ He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? __eou__ Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' __eou__ Indeed you know much about him . __eou__ This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . __eou__
It's snowing heavily . __eou__ It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . __eou__ The snow is so beautiful . __eou__
I'm not a VIP . __eou__ You're too humble . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__
Does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ No . It's all Greek to me . __eou__ She's speaking French , not Greek . __eou__ I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . __eou__ I wish you the best of luck . __eou__
Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? __eou__ Certainly I do . __eou__ It seems you're very fond of it . __eou__ I'd be happy to do something new . __eou__

We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . __eou__ OK . __eou__ How many courses are there altogether , please ? __eou__ Eight . __eou__ Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? __eou__ Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
That looks like an interesting book . __eou__ It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ What sports do they play there ? __eou__ It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ Is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? __eou__ Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . __eou__
What's his job ? __eou__ He used to be a policeman . __eou__ But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . __eou__ Yeah . He's a private eye now . __eou__
I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . __eou__ That's okay . I can explain a little . __eou__ I don't want to lose all my money . __eou__ Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . __eou__ I guess you're right . __eou__ Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? __eou__ Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . __eou__ That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . __eou__ I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . __eou__ But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So how much do you want to gamble ? __eou__ Maybe 500 dollars . __eou__ 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? __eou__ I don't want people to think I'm stingy . __eou__ That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . __eou__
Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ I booked a table yesterday . __eou__ What's your name , please ? __eou__ Smith . __eou__ A minute , please . ... Yes , this way , please . __eou__

Remember ? __eou__ What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? __eou__ Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . __eou__ Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? __eou__ Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? __eou__
I dare you to talk to that girl . __eou__ Okay , I will . __eou__

What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective .

It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much . __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . __eou__ Who wrote it ? __eou__ Mario Puku . __eou__ Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? __eou__ I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . __eou__

What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__

What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Hello , Jack here . __eou__ Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? __eou__ I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . __eou__ Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . __eou__ What about Saturday ? __eou__ Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . __eou__ Will you come round next Tuesday ? __eou__ Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . __eou__ What do you say to next Wednesday then ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Are you free tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . What's wrong ? __eou__ Would you please go to a dancing party with me ? __eou__ OK . No problem . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . __eou__ But it's said that you dance wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? __eou__ No . Just occasionally . __eou__ What are your favourite dances ? __eou__ I love rumba and waltz . __eou__ How about samba ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast . __eou__ Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ? __eou__ OK . See you then . __eou__ See you then . __eou__
Hey Mark . What are you doing ? __eou__ Just watching some TV . __eou__ Anything interesting on ? __eou__ Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . __eou__ So I take it you're pretty bored too . __eou__ Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? __eou__ It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? __eou__ You wanna shoot some hoops ? __eou__ I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . __eou__ Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . __eou__ She's out shopping with her friends . __eou__ Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . __eou__ Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? __eou__ I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . __eou__ Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Aright . See you there . __eou__
Doesn't she have any friends ? __eou__ If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . __eou__ Such friends are even worse than enemies . __eou__ She'd better keep away from them . __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ Stolen ? No , why ? __eou__ My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . __eou__ I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened . __eou__ He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . __eou__ Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? __eou__ You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . __eou__ That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . __eou__
How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . __eou__ Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? __eou__
Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . __eou__ Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . __eou__
Hey , Jack , where's your car ? __eou__ I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . __eou__ Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? __eou__ Jump in , I'll give you a ride . __eou__ Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it costed a bundle alright . __eou__ Wow , this's sinking a hole . __eou__ Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . __eou__ I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . __eou__ We are on the high way . I'm the * * . __eou__ Wow , this car can really burn rubber . __eou__ It's a great feeling . __eou__ You made a perfect choice , Jack . __eou__ Thanks , Daisy . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ Would you like to have lunch with me ? __eou__ Yes . When ? __eou__ Is 11:30 AM OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? __eou__ I said , 11:30 AM . __eou__ Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? __eou__ OK , how about 12:30 PM ? __eou__ OK . Where ? __eou__ How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? __eou__ Oh , Where is that ? __eou__ It's on 7th Street . __eou__ OK , I'll meet you there . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
Hey , Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes , why ? __eou__ Nothing . I'm just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ I'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! __eou__
Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? __eou__ Yes , such as Christmas and Easter . __eou__ What about historic festivals ? __eou__ Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . __eou__
Where is my contract ? __eou__ It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . __eou__
Hello , three-five . __eou__ Is that Anne ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . __eou__ What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time . __eou__ It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . __eou__ That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? __eou__ No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . __eou__ But Anne ... __eou__
What's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ Any rain ? __eou__ No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? __eou__ Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . __eou__ What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? __eou__ I've already got plans , too . __eou__ Then when do you think we could go out together ? __eou__ How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it . __eou__ OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me . __eou__ That's settled then . I'll contact you later . __eou__
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them . __eou__ After you . __eou__
You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . __eou__ How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? __eou__ Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ Are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . __eou__ Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ Of course ! I bought two copies . __eou__ Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? __eou__
What's the score ? __eou__ The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . __eou__ The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . __eou__ It doesn't seem to be so easy . __eou__
Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . __eou__ How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . And you ? __eou__ Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . __eou__
Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . __eou__ Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . __eou__ I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . __eou__ Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . __eou__
Hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ Can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
What's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . __eou__ The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . __eou__ What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . __eou__ Have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . __eou__ The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . __eou__
We'd better leave now . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__
John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? __eou__ Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . __eou__ I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . __eou__
Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . __eou__ That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! __eou__ That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . __eou__
Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... __eou__ Enough is enough . I know . __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . __eou__ Have you done windsurfing before ? __eou__ No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Can you take a little advice from a friend ? __eou__ Sure . What ? __eou__ Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . __eou__ But I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . __eou__ Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? __eou__
Charles , have you finished your homework ? __eou__ Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? __eou__ I want you to have a walk with me . __eou__ I'll finish soon . __eou__
What did the doctor say ? __eou__ He said that I have been eating too much . __eou__ Did he give you any advice ? __eou__ Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . __eou__ Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . __eou__
Who wants to go first ? Allen ? __eou__ Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? __eou__ OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! __eou__ How about As long as You Love Me ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! __eou__ I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__
How ’ s your trip going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here __eou__ Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? __eou__ Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . __eou__ I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? __eou__ Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . __eou__ And what about the number of people on the streets ? __eou__ Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . __eou__ Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you . __eou__
John hasn't got married up to now . __eou__ Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ? __eou__ Really ? Does Mary know that ? __eou__ Of course not . __eou__ How silly John is . __eou__
Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . __eou__ I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? __eou__ That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . __eou__ Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , " Ice Ice Baby , " but I don't know his other songs . __eou__ That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . __eou__
What do you think of doctor Thompson ? __eou__ I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? __eou__ I can tell from the way he spoke to us . __eou__ Never believe his words . __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__
It's quiet everywhere in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like winter . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__ What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . __eou__ Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . __eou__ I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . __eou__ Yes . Very wonderful . __eou__ There is a snowman over there . __eou__ How lovely it is ! __eou__
One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind . __eou__ What did he aim at ? __eou__ He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune . __eou__ How could he have such an ill intention ? I think your father can see that through . __eou__
The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . __eou__ I'm sorry for hero . __eou__ I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . __eou__ Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . __eou__
What did you do last night ? __eou__ I just stayed at home and watched TV . __eou__ Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? __eou__ Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ What were the results of the game ? __eou__ It ended in a tie . __eou__ What was the actual score ? __eou__ It was three all . __eou__ Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__ If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__ How many more games are left this season ? __eou__ That was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ When do the playoffs start ? __eou__ In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? __eou__ Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . __eou__ Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . __eou__ Ok , it's a date then ! __eou__
I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__ I trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__ I ’ m doing great , thank you . __eou__ So we can get down to business . __eou__
You look pale recently . __eou__ Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work . __eou__ Take good care of yourself . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
I want to say ... __eou__ Say it ! What is it ? __eou__ That I can't go on any longer without you . __eou__ You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . __eou__ Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . __eou__ Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . __eou__ Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . __eou__ Stop it . No more of that talk . __eou__ I really love you . __eou__ No , I shall faint . __eou__ And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Jack , what are you doing ? __eou__ I am reading . __eou__ I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? __eou__ No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . __eou__ Can I have a look as well ? __eou__ Of course , have a seat . __eou__ Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . __eou__ Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . __eou__ Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . __eou__ Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . __eou__ Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? __eou__ Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . __eou__
Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? __eou__ Why do I need to do that ? __eou__ My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . __eou__ Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? __eou__ My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? __eou__ Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . __eou__ That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? __eou__ Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . __eou__
What part did you get in the play this time ? __eou__ I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . __eou__ I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . __eou__ I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . __eou__ I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . __eou__ Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . __eou__ I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__
What day is it today ? __eou__ It's Friday . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? __eou__ He's still pretty sick . __eou__ That's too bad . What does he have ? __eou__ We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . __eou__ Let me know if there's anything I can do . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . __eou__
What ’ s on TV tonight ? __eou__ Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . __eou__ Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . __eou__ Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show . __eou__ No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny . __eou__ Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . __eou__ Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . __eou__ That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . __eou__ It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . __eou__ O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . __eou__ No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . __eou__
Hi Kara , this is Mike . __eou__ Hello Mike . How are things going for you ? __eou__ Great , how are you ? __eou__ Fine . Everything is just fine . __eou__ Kara , I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend . __eou__ Mike , I enjoyed your company , but I am getting ready to graduate soon . I really need to focus on my studies . __eou__ Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done . __eou__ It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done , but thank you for a lovely dinner . __eou__
Charles , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How many children do you have ? __eou__ I have two kids . A boy and a girl . __eou__ What are their names ? __eou__ Jack and Stephanie . __eou__ How old are they ? __eou__ Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . __eou__ Are they in school ? __eou__ Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . __eou__ What does Stephanie study ? __eou__ She studies English . __eou__ Is she here now ? __eou__ No , she's at school . __eou__
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
We can't wait any longer ... __eou__ I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... __eou__ You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? __eou__ I can't afford to . __eou__ All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . __eou__ Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . __eou__
My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . __eou__ Excuse me , what did you say ? __eou__ A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . __eou__ That's incredible . I can't believe it . __eou__ You have to . It is sure . __eou__ How amazing ! __eou__
Merry Christmas ! Let ’ s paint the town red . __eou__ Cheers ! __eou__
I'll talk to you later . __eou__ What's the rush ? __eou__ I have to get off the phone now . __eou__ I'm not ready to get off the phone with you . __eou__ There are other things I need to take care of . __eou__ What is it that you need to do ? __eou__ Please don't be nosey . __eou__ I'm not being nosey , it's just a question . __eou__ You don't need to worry about that . __eou__ That was mean to say . __eou__ I am very sorry , but I must go . __eou__ I guess . __eou__
Can you recommend a resort to me ? __eou__ What about the Yellowstone National Park ? __eou__ Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking . __eou__ What is especially impressive ? __eou__ There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them . __eou__ Is there a waterfall ? __eou__ Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . __eou__ What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? __eou__ You can take No . 2 bus . __eou__
Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . __eou__ How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you . __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A cup of coffee , please . __eou__
Why don't you go out with Jack ? __eou__ He makes me sick . __eou__
Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? __eou__ Why do you listen to rap ? __eou__ It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . __eou__ Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . __eou__ Hey , you can dance to rap music ! __eou__ I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . __eou__
Adam , I'm sorry ! __eou__ But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . __eou__
I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now ! __eou__ I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . __eou__
Hi . You enjoying the party ? __eou__ Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? __eou__ Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . __eou__ Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ? __eou__ I'm in finance . You ? __eou__ Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them . __eou__ T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ? __eou__ About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? __eou__ No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day . __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the five thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up 25 present . __eou__
Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . __eou__ That's okay . Better late than never . __eou__
Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . __eou__ Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . __eou__ All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? __eou__ Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . __eou__
I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ But it ’ s so old . __eou__ Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ No , not at all . __eou__ First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ Why does he want to do that ? __eou__ Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ It would take a lot less time ... __eou__ How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ Ok . That sounds like a deal . __eou__
What kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
Who ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ me . Susan Taylor __eou__ Oh , please come in . nice to see you . __eou__ On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house . __eou__ Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? __eou__ It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__ Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? __eou__
Where is Pamela ? __eou__ Is she coming ? __eou__ She told me she'd be here . __eou__ They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . __eou__ Are you rushing me ? __eou__ I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? __eou__ I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? __eou__ Name it and I'll do it for you . __eou__ Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . __eou__ I've got it . __eou__ Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . __eou__ I am just doing what I think I should do . __eou__ Thank you for being a friend of mine . __eou__ This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business . __eou__ Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__ Do many people like tennis ? __eou__ More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
Cindy . We were going to try to surprise you for your birthday . But you ’ re just too busy ! Can you tell me when you ’ ll be free ? __eou__ Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys .

Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . __eou__ Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . __eou__ Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? __eou__ Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . __eou__ Is it a used one ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . __eou__
Do you like music ? __eou__ Well , it depends . __eou__ Do you think the music is well-matched ? __eou__ No , I think the music is too fast . __eou__ How about the words of the song ? __eou__ It sounds nice . __eou__ I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . __eou__ Yes , I think so . It's very emotional . __eou__ Of course , and I also like the rhythms . __eou__ Full of energy and hope . __eou__ Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying . __eou__ Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . __eou__
Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! __eou__ You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent . __eou__ I do agree with you . __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . __eou__ You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? __eou__ My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl __eou__ Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . __eou__ Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__ No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy __eou__ If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? __eou__ That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like __eou__ Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__ I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! __eou__
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . __eou__ Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__ Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! __eou__ No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__ What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__ He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__ Must be one smart guy . __eou__
Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I need to cancel that .

Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__
what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . __eou__ to be honest , I was just dumped . __eou__ oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . __eou__ no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . __eou__ come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . __eou__ well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? __eou__ where is that ? __eou__ not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . __eou__ what's there to see ? __eou__ there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . __eou__ oh , sounds nice . __eou__ yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like . __eou__ ok . Then I can make up my mind . __eou__
What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . __eou__
Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? __eou__ I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . __eou__ What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? __eou__ Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . __eou__ And your parents took it badly ? __eou__ That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . __eou__ Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? __eou__ She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . __eou__ How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? __eou__ Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . __eou__ Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . __eou__ I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . __eou__
Table-tennis is our national game . __eou__ Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well . __eou__ I can't , either . I like watching . __eou__
Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . __eou__ I never knew that . __eou__ Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool . __eou__ Well , we ’ Ve already done our part . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days . The baby ’ s finally growing up a little more . __eou__ Well , give me a call if you can ’ t make it for some reason . __eou__
Are you really dating with Frank ? __eou__ Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . __eou__ Then why not keep away from him ? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__ That ’ s stupid . __eou__
So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? __eou__ Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . __eou__ You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? __eou__ Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . __eou__
Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? __eou__ It's an excellent one . I like it very much . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that'll affect the national economy . __eou__ That's right.But I don't think there are better ways . __eou__ How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__
Yo baby , are you satisfied with the costume show in the street ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say.Just so-so . __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ Are you deaf or what ? __eou__

How are you doing , Christopher ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! __eou__ Are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! __eou__ Are you available on Sunday ? __eou__ Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . __eou__ Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? __eou__ That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? __eou__ It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ What should I bring with me ? __eou__ We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . __eou__ Do you like surfing ? __eou__ I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? __eou__ We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! __eou__ I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? __eou__ You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . __eou__ Ok , where and when should I meet you ? __eou__ We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! __eou__
Are you getting overtime ? __eou__ Yes , but it's not so appetizing . __eou__ Have you thought about another job ? __eou__ That's what's hanging on my mind recently . __eou__
Have the aerobic classes any effect on you ? __eou__ Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 . __eou__ Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . __eou__
There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ Look , I have two tickets.Will you go with me ? __eou__ Wow , I like concerts . __eou__
Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? __eou__ I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . __eou__ Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . __eou__ But I still have to tell her . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Tell you what , give me your phone number . __eou__ It's 555-4321 . __eou__ Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information . __eou__ Don ’ t put me on the spot . You know , I can ’ t do that . __eou__
I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . __eou__ Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . __eou__ I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . __eou__ A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . __eou__ Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . __eou__
Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea . __eou__ I really love this music . It's a compilation . __eou__ I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs . __eou__ And you got them off the Net ? __eou__ No . I recorded these from your Cds . __eou__ Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record ! __eou__ I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy ... __eou__
Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Where is our waitress anyway ? __eou__ Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? __eou__ I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__ Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__ So the bill is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__ I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__ Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__ I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . __eou__
What have you been up to , Johnny ? __eou__ You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... __eou__ Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? __eou__ You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . __eou__ You have all the fun , don't you ? __eou__ Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . __eou__ Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! __eou__

Wait for me 。 __eou__ Okay . Take your time . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat .

She will worry if I get home late . __eou__ What a pity ! The party is very interesting . __eou__ I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me . __eou__ Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety . __eou__ You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . __eou__
The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? __eou__ Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . __eou__ That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? __eou__ It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? __eou__ Yeah . I think I can find it . __eou__ You're back already . That sure was quick . __eou__ That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . __eou__ Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . __eou__ Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__

How was your date with Betty ? __eou__ Let's change the subject . __eou__
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? __eou__ Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . __eou__ Would you take $ 12 ? __eou__ No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? __eou__ 13.50 ? __eou__ Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . __eou__ Yes , of course . It was nice to see you . __eou__ It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__
What's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . __eou__ Is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . __eou__
It doesn't look very nice outside today . __eou__ You're right . I think it's going to rain later . __eou__ In the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining . __eou__ That wouldn't seem right . __eou__ Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . __eou__ Exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . It's too hot . __eou__ I know , you're absolutely right . __eou__ I wish it would cool off one day . __eou__ That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon . __eou__ I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean , but I'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel . __eou__
Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ Does she teach Chinese ? __eou__ No , she is an English teacher . __eou__ And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? __eou__ You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . __eou__

How about doing shopping this weekend ? __eou__ What're you going to buy ? __eou__ Sportshoes.Will you go with me ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
What are you reading ? __eou__ It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . __eou__ Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . __eou__ Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? __eou__ The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . __eou__ Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . __eou__ Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . __eou__ In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . __eou__
Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . __eou__ I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . __eou__ Really ? I hope to meet him soon . __eou__

Dutch means you both pay your own way . __eou__ Oh , I wonder if she ’ ll go for that . __eou__
The time has come to say goodbye . __eou__ So soon . It seems as if you just got here . __eou__ I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . __eou__ It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . __eou__ I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . __eou__ It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine . __eou__ You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring . __eou__ I'll be expecting you then . __eou__

So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . __eou__
There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ? __eou__ Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one . __eou__ It is so kind of you , Dad . __eou__
You're so witty ... __eou__ So why is the face tilted to the right ? __eou__ This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . __eou__ So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? __eou__ It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . __eou__ I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... __eou__ Bingo ! __eou__
I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . __eou__ Well , let's get together soon . __eou__ Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? __eou__ Sure . How about Monday ? __eou__ Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday .

I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? __eou__ Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . __eou__ So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? __eou__ You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? __eou__

Well , good for her . __eou__ Now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ Yes , she will .

Do you still see the people we went to school with ? __eou__ I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . __eou__ Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . __eou__ Oh yes , how's she getting on ? __eou__ OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . __eou__ What , from Peter ? __eou__ Oh , of course . __eou__
How is night life in Beijing ? __eou__ Very interesting ! __eou__ What do you suggest then ? __eou__ How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . __eou__ That's a great idea .

What about wine ? __eou__ Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? __eou__ No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . __eou__ I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . __eou__ Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . __eou__
Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . __eou__ Of course ! Where are the things ? __eou__ They're all here . __eou__ Right ! I'll do it straight away . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . __eou__

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . __eou__

Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so .

Matthew ? Hi ! __eou__ Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? __eou__ it's got to be almost a year now . __eou__ how have you been ? __eou__ I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . __eou__ yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? __eou__ not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__ well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__ Mrs . Thou ? __eou__ yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! __eou__ I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? __eou__
Bob , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . __eou__ Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__ I know your feeling . Take it easy . __eou__
The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . __eou__ I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures . __eou__ I ’ m sure they will . __eou__

Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . __eou__
Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . __eou__ Who ’ s that boy ? __eou__ Where ? __eou__ The one next to the telephone . __eou__ I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? __eou__ I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . __eou__

What's the bonus like at your company ? __eou__ Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . __eou__ Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ?

I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with !

What happened ? __eou__ Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . __eou__ That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? __eou__ Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . __eou__ That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? __eou__ Early in the New Year I guess . __eou__

I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__

I'll just stay here until you get back . __eou__ So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . __eou__ How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? __eou__ I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . __eou__ I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__ I think that we should leave 10 % . __eou__ $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . __eou__

Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? __eou__ I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . __eou__ Sure , they do . __eou__ But why do you choose cycling at first ? __eou__ Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection . __eou__ You are really a good citizen . __eou__ That ’ s what I can do . __eou__
Did you bring some lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , I packed it myself . __eou__ Wow , that looks beautiful . __eou__ It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . __eou__ I might try it myself . __eou__

Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? __eou__ I'm afraid so . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ That's a secret . __eou__

What ’ s more , his wife is 84 . __eou__ Is she really ? __eou__ Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . __eou__ Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? __eou__
How is your business going ? __eou__ Business couldn't be better . __eou__ Really ? Maybe I should work for you . __eou__ Welcome . I could use the help . __eou__
what happened ? Why didn't he win ? __eou__ didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . __eou__ how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ let's hope so . __eou__
Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I have a big date tonight . __eou__ You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . __eou__
Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! __eou__ Where did you end up going ? __eou__ Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . __eou__ I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? __eou__ That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? __eou__ Sure . What's this one a picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ You don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__ My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? __eou__ Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . __eou__ That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__
It's too hot to read . __eou__ We'd better go out for a walk . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ Spring . __eou__ How about summer ? __eou__ I dislike it most . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the hottest season is summer in a year . __eou__ But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . __eou__ Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? __eou__ No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow night . __eou__
What will you do now ? Propose to her . __eou__ Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . __eou__ You should strike while the iron is hot . __eou__ You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . __eou__
How is Jim recently ? __eou__ He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . __eou__ Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . __eou__
David , would you like something to eat ? __eou__ No , I'm full . __eou__ Do you want something to drink ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like some coffee . __eou__ Sorry , I don't have any coffee . __eou__ That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . __eou__ A small glass , or a big one ? __eou__ Small please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? __eou__ It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . __eou__
Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ? __eou__ Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . __eou__
Who are those guys ? __eou__ Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . __eou__ Oh . __eou__ Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! __eou__ All right ! __eou__ Here comes Jordan , though . __eou__ Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . __eou__ Which team do you think will win ? __eou__ The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__
Where should I sit ? __eou__ Why don't you sit in the back with me ? __eou__ Okay . __eou__ By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is . __eou__ It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N . __eou__ R-I-N ? __eou__ My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin . __eou__ I got it . Mary Lin . __eou__ Lin is a common Chinese last name . __eou__
Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? __eou__ Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . __eou__ I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . __eou__
Are you going to the party on Saturday ? __eou__ I was thinking about it . Are you ? __eou__ Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? Well , what time does it start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ Everyone from school . __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . __eou__ Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party ? __eou__ Yeah , I will be there . __eou__
Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work . __eou__ Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too . __eou__ One less car on the road means less pollution . __eou__ Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . __eou__ How far is it ? __eou__ Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train . __eou__ You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too . __eou__ True . Well , see you tomorrow . __eou__ See you . __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__
this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ yes , I mean it . __eou__ but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__ I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__ but I still love you . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__ well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__ I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__ I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__ I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ shall we keep Our friendship ? __eou__ sure , let ’ s just be friends . __eou__
Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there . __eou__ Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? __eou__ ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . __eou__ Then we'd better not go . __eou__ OK . __eou__
There has been talk at school about canceling the concert . __eou__ Really ? Who did you hear that from ? __eou__ Just word of mouth . __eou__
Thanks for your hospitality . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . __eou__ You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . __eou__ I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . __eou__ But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . __eou__
Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . __eou__ You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? __eou__ Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . __eou__ Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . __eou__ OK , they begin to register . __eou__ It's time I left . __eou__ Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . __eou__
Who's your favorite film star ? __eou__ Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star . __eou__ What films feature him ? __eou__ Many ! __eou__
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__ Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? __eou__ I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . __eou__ Good . I totally agree with what you did . __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
I heard that Ann had divorced . __eou__ I suspect it's unavoidable . __eou__ Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . __eou__ Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . __eou__ You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . __eou__
Are you alright , child ? __eou__ Hey , I still know my name . __eou__ What did the nurse say ? __eou__ She said I have a fever but nothing major . __eou__ In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . __eou__ What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? __eou__ Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . __eou__ what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__ oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie .

I've got a membership there . __eou__ is it good ? __eou__ yes , you can find almost all new releases there . __eou__ really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . __eou__ why not ? __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__
Hi , Bill . __eou__ Hi , Jim . __eou__ Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . __eou__ He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . __eou__ Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? __eou__ Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . __eou__
Did you go to see Michael last night ? __eou__ Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle . __eou__ Did he let you ride it ? __eou__ Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it . __eou__ Weren ’ t you frightened ? __eou__ Sure . But I still liked it . __eou__ Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ? __eou__ No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . __eou__ But why ? Since you like it so much . __eou__ Because bicycles are safer . __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__

Do you have a boyfriend ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So I think I may fall in love with her . __eou__ You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? __eou__ Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? __eou__ That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . __eou__ That's what I did . __eou__ And you think about her all the time ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . __eou__ That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . __eou__ Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate . __eou__ Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another . __eou__ Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . __eou__ Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! __eou__ While staying in love is even better . __eou__

Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just watching some television . __eou__ I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . __eou__ Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? __eou__ I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . __eou__ That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? __eou__ That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . __eou__ I like to play the piano for fun . __eou__ Yeah . That can be a good hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . __eou__ That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__

Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? __eou__ I didn't sleep much last night . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . __eou__ Don't you like games __eou__ I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . __eou__ Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
I had a wonderful evening . __eou__ I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
What time is it by your watch ? __eou__ I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . __eou__ It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . __eou__ Let's ask someone else . __eou__
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
Did you hear about Neil ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ I hear that he's quitting . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
We'd like to have a look around your house ? __eou__ Yes , of course , please follow me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ This is our courtyard . __eou__ It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? __eou__ Yes , about 46 square metres . __eou__ Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? __eou__ They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . __eou__ Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . __eou__
Has your son started school yet , Tom ? __eou__ Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him ! __eou__ He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ? __eou__ You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it ! __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . __eou__ I'll try to speak more clearly . __eou__
You seem to be very tired . __eou__ Yes , I have been working for eight hours . __eou__ Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? __eou__ No , really . I'm not in the mood for it . __eou__
Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ? __eou__ Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones __eou__ May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? __eou__ Possibly . __eou__
So you're going picnicking ? __eou__ Yeah . I'm going with Jennie . __eou__ Have a good day ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ sure , but how ? __eou__ you can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ easier said than done . __eou__ you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ but I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? __eou__ Yes I am . And you ... __eou__ I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . __eou__ So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us ? __eou__ Well , you always say you're busy . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . __eou__ I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . __eou__ Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . __eou__ You mean I am groaned a few words ? __eou__ Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . __eou__
John has some trouble in his life . __eou__ I hear that his father died . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s been having an easy time since he was a boy , and now he doesn ’ t know how to face the music . __eou__ He is out of luck . __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . __eou__ nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . __eou__ I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . __eou__ you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . __eou__
How do you like skiing , Pat ? __eou__ I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . __eou__ I suppose skiing is easy for you . __eou__ No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . __eou__ I see . Do you ski often ? __eou__ Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? __eou__ Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg __eou__ Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . __eou__
Susan has got married . __eou__ Really ? How do you know that ? __eou__ Her marriage was a hole and corner affair . __eou__ Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ... __eou__
I want to give our kitchen the works . __eou__ Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . __eou__ No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . __eou__ Why should we run after the fashion ? __eou__ I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . __eou__
This is my uncle , Charles . __eou__ He looks strong.What does he do ? __eou__ He's a captain . __eou__ He must be very brave . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
Excuse me , haven't we met somewhere before ? __eou__ Yes , I'm Jame , your neighbor when you lived in here last year . __eou__ Oh , I see.Glad to see you here . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__ I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__ And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . __eou__ No , I wouldn't think so . __eou__ I do wish I could lose weight . __eou__ Well , why don't you go on the diet ? __eou__ I've tried diets before but they've never worked . __eou__ Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should . __eou__
Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . __eou__ How high did the price go ? __eou__ I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 . __eou__ You didn't watch the end of the auction ? __eou__ No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . __eou__
Um , what will you do this weekend ? __eou__ How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . __eou__ A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? __eou__ No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? __eou__ Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . __eou__
Here's 30 yuan for my ticket . __eou__ Keep it . I'm buying tonight . __eou__ No , you can't do that . __eou__ Sure I can , my treat . __eou__
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__
hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? __eou__ The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . __eou__ He is cute.What dose he do ? __eou__ I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . __eou__ Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__

The manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ Well , Rose , __eou__ Is there something you need ? __eou__ Are your free this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I have nothing to do . __eou__ Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ Is 5 PM . a good time for you ? __eou__ Hmm , how about seven ?

How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__
Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ? __eou__ Hi Martha . Everything is perfect . __eou__ Are you enjoying married life ? __eou__ It couldn't be better .

Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends . __eou__ Do you guys do anything special ? __eou__ In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . __eou__ Sound like everything is great . __eou__
Labor is an abundant resource here . __eou__ One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . __eou__
Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . __eou__ What's the second solar system ? __eou__ It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . __eou__ Is this good news or bad news ? __eou__ It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! __eou__ You mean with people on it ? __eou__ Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? __eou__
Hey George , how is your chicken ? __eou__ My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? __eou__ My fish is pretty dry too . __eou__ It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . __eou__ Yes , it seems that way to me also . __eou__ How are your vegetables ? __eou__ My vegetables are very soggy . __eou__ Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . __eou__ I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . __eou__ I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . __eou__
Guess what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__
I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . __eou__ Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . __eou__ Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . __eou__
I'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ Snipers ? __eou__ Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? __eou__ I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . __eou__

I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__ You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ I drink a lot of wine . __eou__ If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ I often feel so tired . __eou__ You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__
have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . __eou__ On this occasion , most people do . __eou__ Oh , they are playing the wedding March .

It's just hidden . __eou__
Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__
Where is your native place ? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ So are you a local ? __eou__ Yes , I am a local resident . __eou__
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . __eou__ I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . __eou__ Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . __eou__
If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . __eou__ Come off it . __eou__ You want a bet ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . __eou__ What's he like ? __eou__ Oh , he's a very serious person . __eou__ You must feel very uneasy at his home . __eou__
Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . __eou__ Did it spill on your clothes ? __eou__ No , but the table cloth was dirty . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . __eou__ It's no big deal . __eou__ I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . __eou__ Don't be silly , forget about it . __eou__
good morning ! __eou__ good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! __eou__ that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__ I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__ that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__ for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__ just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . __eou__ Ok , I'll try that . __eou__ is there anything else bothering you ? __eou__ just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . __eou__ do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__ I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . __eou__ try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__ you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! __eou__
Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ? __eou__ I was unable to make it . __eou__ You should have been there . It was intense . __eou__ Is that right . Who ended up winning ? __eou__ Our team was victorious . __eou__ I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go . __eou__ It was a great game . __eou__ What was the score at the end of the game ? __eou__ Our team won 101-98 . __eou__ Sounds like it was a close game . __eou__ That's the reason it was such a great game . __eou__ The next game , I will definitely be there . __eou__
Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! __eou__ Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . __eou__ Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . __eou__ Those clothes do suit him better . __eou__ Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? __eou__ Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? __eou__
What's your number ? __eou__ I'm number seven . What about you ? __eou__ Five . __eou__ Hah hah ! You have to go before me . __eou__ You think it's funny . I'm terrified . __eou__ Don't worry . It's safe . __eou__ But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . __eou__ You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . __eou__ I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . __eou__ I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . __eou__
Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? __eou__ Just between you and me , I think he's lazy . __eou__ Haven't you ever seen him working late ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ I'm moblogging ! __eou__ Moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . __eou__ Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__ Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ What if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ You bet it ! __eou__
Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ? __eou__ No , but we still stay in touch . __eou__ What's the way you keep in contact ? __eou__ We contact through email . __eou__ Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better . __eou__ Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference . __eou__ You're right . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__
Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ? __eou__ Not bad . Everything goes well . __eou__
I just meant that she's got different taste . __eou__ What kind of girl is she ? __eou__ She's pretty conservative . __eou__ Is her fiance Taiwanese ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? __eou__
How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__ I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__ I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . __eou__ Do you have a brand preference for anything ? __eou__ I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . __eou__ What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? __eou__ It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . __eou__ I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! __eou__ To each their own ! __eou__
What ? You golden watch is lost ? __eou__ Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__ It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . __eou__ Let's get it back . __eou__

Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ Pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! __eou__ Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ Nice ! Let ' s go ! __eou__
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__
If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__ It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__ Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__ I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__ And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__ Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__ What'll you have ? __eou__ I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__ I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__ All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__
Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . __eou__ Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . __eou__ I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . __eou__ This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . __eou__ Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . __eou__ So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? __eou__ We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! __eou__
Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ? __eou__ You said it . We ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . __eou__ I think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . And people should try to protect environment . __eou__ I absolutely agree with you . __eou__
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ Tell me all about it . __eou__ Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__ Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . __eou__
Do you think the bad weather will last long ? __eou__ I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . __eou__ I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . __eou__ Good idea . Thanks a billion . __eou__
The weekend's finally here ! __eou__ And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . __eou__ Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . __eou__ Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? __eou__ We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . __eou__ I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . __eou__
Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . __eou__ Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . __eou__ That must be very beautiful . __eou__ Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . __eou__ Really ? Have you ever been there ? __eou__ A couple of times . __eou__ Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . __eou__ Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
Are you still busy today ? __eou__ It seems to be . How about you today ? __eou__ Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . __eou__ OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . __eou__ Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__
I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__ Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . __eou__ I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__ It seems you have to take time . __eou__
I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . __eou__ Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? __eou__ She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . __eou__
Honey , do you have a second ? __eou__ Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? __eou__ We need to talk . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__ So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__ Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__ I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__ Laura ... __eou__ Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . __eou__

With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__ I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__ if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__ that sounds like fun . __eou__ hey , look outside !

Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to .

I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend . __eou__ You mean you want to stay at home ? __eou__ Yes , exactly . __eou__ I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . __eou__
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it was very interesting . __eou__ What were the schools like ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . __eou__ But you taught children , yes ? __eou__ Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . __eou__ They actually study after school ? __eou__ That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . __eou__ Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? __eou__ Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . __eou__ Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . __eou__ So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . __eou__ But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . __eou__ As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . __eou__ Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? __eou__ That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . __eou__ Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? __eou__ I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on . __eou__
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? __eou__ Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . __eou__ Of course . __eou__
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? __eou__ No , have they have another fight ? __eou__ No , they got engaged . __eou__ You must be joking . Those two ? __eou__ Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . __eou__ So when did all this happen ? __eou__ Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . __eou__ Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? __eou__ Next June . __eou__ I can hardly believe it . __eou__
Thank you for your letter . __eou__ Is your waist any better ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . __eou__ I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__ And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__ Then when will you be back again ? __eou__ I will be back again next Wednesday . __eou__ I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . __eou__ Which flight ? __eou__ Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . __eou__ How about the passengers ? __eou__ Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . __eou__
I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ? __eou__ You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . __eou__
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I am not sure . What are you doing ? __eou__ I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . __eou__ That sounds like a great idea ! __eou__ Would you be interested in joining me ? __eou__ Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? __eou__ I thought that we could leave around 8 __eou__ That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? __eou__ That was part of my plan . __eou__ Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . __eou__
are you a blogger ? __eou__ sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__ oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? __eou__ I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . __eou__ what do you usually write about ? __eou__ at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an __eou__ that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? __eou__ it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__ got it . Are you still updating your blog ? __eou__ sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . __eou__ good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . __eou__
are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ it wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . __eou__
Mr . Brown is in hospital again . __eou__ Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy . __eou__ When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . __eou__ I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . __eou__
I am tired of everything in my life . __eou__ What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . __eou__ You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__
I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . __eou__ Are you angry , Lisa ? __eou__ Angry ? Why would I be ? __eou__ Please don't tell my mom . __eou__ Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . __eou__ I'm glad that you see it that way . __eou__ Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . __eou__ Thank you so much , Lisa ! __eou__

Steven , why are you so depressed ? __eou__ I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . __eou__ What's the news ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . __eou__ It's horrible . __eou__ Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . __eou__ Yes . How about donating some money ? __eou__ It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? __eou__ Just find the answer through Internet . __eou__ Yes , let's do it now . __eou__
Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room . __eou__ Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . __eou__ I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . __eou__ Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! __eou__ Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . __eou__ To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? __eou__ Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there . __eou__
Bob ! __eou__ Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages.How ' Ve you been ? __eou__ Fine , just fine.And you ? __eou__ Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ? __eou__ Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . __eou__
I just got fired . __eou__ You asked for it . __eou__
Do you really have to work today ? __eou__ Yes . I'm afraid so . __eou__ But you'll miss out on the football game . __eou__ Oh . Well , it can't be helped . __eou__
Tim's always bothering me . __eou__ Just tell him off . __eou__
What's the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . __eou__ How's your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
You look pale today . __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning . __eou__ You should do sports to keep young . __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . __eou__
who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? __eou__ indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__
So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ? __eou__ Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite . __eou__ You know what comedy I really like ? " Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . " I think Jim Carry is really funny . __eou__ Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . __eou__ I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is " Titanic . " __eou__
What was the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ It might be . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Li . __eou__ Morning , Mike . __eou__ I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . __eou__ I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? __eou__ I feel much better now . __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on . __eou__
Mary likes mountain climbing . __eou__ What ? No kidding ! __eou__ Yes , she's a professional climber . __eou__ I can't believe it ! __eou__
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . __eou__
You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? __eou__ There are three of them , the Three Tenors . __eou__ Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? __eou__ Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . __eou__ I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . __eou__ Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . __eou__ Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . __eou__ Who was the conductor at that event ? __eou__ Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . __eou__ So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . __eou__ The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . __eou__ I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . __eou__
Did you watch television last night , Charles ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ It was a good game , wasn't it ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__ What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__ How did it finish ? __eou__ It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? __eou__ It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__ No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . __eou__
When was America discovered , Tony ? __eou__ I'm not certain . Do you know ? __eou__ America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . __eou__ In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? __eou__ All right . Ask me a question now . __eou__ Who invented the electric light bulb ? __eou__ That's easy . It was invented by Edison . __eou__ Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? __eou__ I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . __eou__ Ask me a question now . __eou__ All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__ That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__
How do you feel about that restaurant ? __eou__ It wasn't all that great . __eou__ What did you dislike the most ? __eou__ I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . __eou__ Did you think that the food was any good ? __eou__ I wasn't all that impressed by the food . __eou__ The service certainly could have been better . __eou__ The service did not help the situation . __eou__ Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? __eou__ I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . __eou__
Shall we sing with a karaoke ? __eou__ Great idea ! I do it every so often . __eou__ For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . __eou__ Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? __eou__ I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . __eou__ I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . __eou__ Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? __eou__ So tricky ! __eou__
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . __eou__ We could find a classical one . __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__
How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ? __eou__ Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__ What do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . __eou__ How do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . __eou__
Are you going out again ? __eou__ Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . __eou__ You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . __eou__ Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? __eou__ No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . __eou__ Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . __eou__ OK . Here's the key . Take care . __eou__ I will . Thank you , dad . __eou__
Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ? __eou__ The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . __eou__ I can lend you some money . __eou__ Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . __eou__ Can I help you in anyway ? __eou__ You can take me to the bank if you want to . __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . __eou__
ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? __eou__ We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . __eou__ What is the rate ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . __eou__ How about mileage and gas ? __eou__ There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . __eou__ OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . __eou__ All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__
How's work ? __eou__ The same as usual . __eou__
What's the time ? My watch has stopped . __eou__ Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ I think so . I see it by the radio this morning . __eou__
Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . __eou__ Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . __eou__ Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? __eou__ That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . __eou__ Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ I love running . Anything else ? __eou__ Please change your clothes first ! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . __eou__ Sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . __eou__
Do I need a visa ? __eou__ No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . __eou__ Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . __eou__ Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__ You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__ Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__
I plan to buy a car this year . __eou__ How do you pay for it ? __eou__ I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . __eou__ Tell me if you need help . __eou__
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . __eou__ Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . __eou__ This situation isn't easy to handle . __eou__
Do you think I should ask Bob to help ? Will he come ? __eou__ No problem . You know him . He ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I have bothered him several times . __eou__ I bet he will come . __eou__
it's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__ is she American ? __eou__ yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__ not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__ thanks ! __eou__
Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? __eou__ That's a good idea , Charlotte . __eou__ It's ready . Do you want any milk ? __eou__ Just a little please . __eou__ What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? __eou__ No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice . __eou__ Would you like some more ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ? __eou__ Of course . I think there are a few in that box . __eou__ I'm afraid it's empty . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! __eou__ That's very good advice ! __eou__
I hear you're moving to New York . __eou__ Yes , I found a very good job down there . __eou__ Well , we'll certainly miss you in Boston . __eou__ I'm going to miss you folks , too . __eou__ Let's keep in touch . __eou__ OK . I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there . __eou__
It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? __eou__ It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__ What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . __eou__ That doesn't sound pretty . __eou__ Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . __eou__ You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__ I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__ If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! __eou__ English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . __eou__
Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . __eou__ I dare you to say that again . __eou__
Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! __eou__ Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! __eou__ I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . __eou__ Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . __eou__ That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . __eou__ I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? __eou__ Always . __eou__
Hey Joe , how have you been ? __eou__ I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? __eou__ I am doing OK , Joe . __eou__ There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? __eou__ I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . __eou__ I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? __eou__ Did you have a certain movie in mind ? __eou__ I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . __eou__ I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__ Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! __eou__
Harry , do you like the opera ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ Why is that ? It is called real art . __eou__ Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__ Yeah , that makes sense . __eou__
I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? __eou__ It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! __eou__ I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . __eou__ That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! __eou__ How Ay clients do you have already ? __eou__ Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . __eou__ Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . __eou__ If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you . __eou__
Life's so boring . __eou__ Well , most of the time it is , I guess . __eou__ What do you think will make you happy ? __eou__ I think money will make me happy . __eou__ You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . __eou__ It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . __eou__ You'll get bored eventually . __eou__ Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . __eou__ That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . __eou__ You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . __eou__
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__
His grandfather is the richest person in the area . __eou__ What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . __eou__ His grandfather's money is not his . __eou__ I can't understand him anyway . __eou__
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run.It was nice talking to you , karren . __eou__ Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I guess we'll see just around . __eou__ Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . __eou__ You too . __eou__
Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ It was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . __eou__ Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ What else did you see ? __eou__ Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ You must have had a great time . __eou__ Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . __eou__ Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . __eou__ That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ You'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
Ashley , what a great dinner party ! __eou__ Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . __eou__ Just water would be fine . __eou__ Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? __eou__ Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! __eou__ How about some salad to go with your chicken ? __eou__ Sure , I love salad ! __eou__ Would you like to have rice with your chicken ? __eou__ Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! __eou__ Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . __eou__
I think my car can run much faster than yours . __eou__ But mine equals yours in economy . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I am very proud of John . __eou__ Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . __eou__ But he has suffered a lot . __eou__
Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ Wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ Have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ That sure didn't last long ! __eou__
I ’ m deeply grateful for all you ’ Ve done . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . I enjoyed helping you . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like fat girls . __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? __eou__ I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . __eou__ Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . __eou__ Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drinks after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__

Do you ? __eou__ No , this is my first time here . __eou__ I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . __eou__ That ’ s good . It ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . __eou__ I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too .

I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . __eou__ Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ Oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . __eou__ II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . __eou__
I have an idea for Christmas this year . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Let's not exchange any gifts at all . __eou__ You big scrooge ! __eou__ Hear me out .

Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__

It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall .

I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ The same question to you . __eou__ Well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ Deal , Where is Gucci ? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . __eou__ Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . __eou__ I want to be like her . __eou__ Get real . Don't be so pathetic . __eou__ Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . __eou__ Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . __eou__ Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . __eou__ Are you out of your mind ? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . __eou__ Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . __eou__

Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! Mary ! __eou__ Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . __eou__ Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you .

I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . __eou__

Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__

I am kind of nervous . __eou__ Nervous ? Why ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . __eou__ Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . __eou__ Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . __eou__ Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ Alright . But will we sing ? __eou__ Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ I don't know the words . __eou__ There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . __eou__ And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . __eou__ Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? __eou__ That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . __eou__ It doesn't sound like an English word . __eou__ It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . __eou__ Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . __eou__
I'm feeling down . __eou__ Come on . Cheer up ! __eou__

I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . __eou__ It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? __eou__ Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? __eou__ Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . __eou__ Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__ Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . __eou__ Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . __eou__ Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . __eou__
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ Yep . And it breathes , see ! __eou__ It's not breathing ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around ! __eou__
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . __eou__ If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . __eou__ No way , if it still has 21 . __eou__
What would you reckon the taxing increases ? __eou__ Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . __eou__ But what do most people think about it ? __eou__ Ah , it ’ s hard to say . __eou__
Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . __eou__ I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ I see . OK . __eou__
Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! __eou__ Thanks.Miss Zhang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . __eou__
Is that boy standing there your brother ? __eou__ No.My brother is playing football there . __eou__ He's really a good player . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . __eou__
Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ I like to read Fortune . __eou__ Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . __eou__ Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ You are right about that . __eou__
My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . __eou__ Really ? I have a weakness for coffee . __eou__
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? __eou__ I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . __eou__ Where did you spend your holiday ? __eou__ I went to Paris . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . __eou__ Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! __eou__ OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? __eou__ Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? __eou__ Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! __eou__
Look ! It's clearing up . __eou__ I can see the sun now . __eou__ I like summer as long as it's bright like this . __eou__ Anyway , I dislike summer here.There ' s too much rainfall . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
Cigarette ? __eou__ Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , here . __eou__ Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . __eou__ I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . __eou__ Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__
Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? __eou__ Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . __eou__ I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . __eou__ Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . __eou__ Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . I think I'm lucky . __eou__ Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . __eou__
All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . __eou__ What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? __eou__ Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! __eou__ Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . __eou__ Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... __eou__ Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ... __eou__
Have you found a new job yet ? __eou__ No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . __eou__ What kind of work ? __eou__ I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company . __eou__ What do you do there ? __eou__ Mostly office work - filing and so on . __eou__ How long is the assignment ? __eou__ Till the end of the month . __eou__
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! __eou__ Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! __eou__
Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ? __eou__ Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings . __eou__ Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future . __eou__ You can bet on that . __eou__
What book is that ? __eou__ I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . __eou__ Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . __eou__ There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__
When were you born may I ask ? __eou__ On 20th May 1963 . __eou__ Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? __eou__ 27th day of the fourth month . __eou__ By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? __eou__ It will begin at five thirty . __eou__ I am frigid I can't be there on time . __eou__ You can see it tomorrow . __eou__ I don't want to miss it today . __eou__ See you . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? __eou__ Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . __eou__
Tom , I've got good news for you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! __eou__ You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . __eou__ Thanks for the compliment . __eou__ You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! __eou__
Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? __eou__ You got me on that one . __eou__
... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . __eou__ Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! __eou__ What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . __eou__ It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? __eou__ Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . __eou__ You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! __eou__ That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . __eou__
How was your date recently ? __eou__ Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . __eou__ Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ Forget about it ! __eou__ Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . __eou__
So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . __eou__ But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . __eou__ That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . __eou__ That's why I am going to leave . __eou__ But you have already worked there for five years . __eou__ I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . __eou__ Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . __eou__ Do we need to book a table in advance ? __eou__ No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . __eou__ What time shall we go ? __eou__ Why not now ? I'm hungry . __eou__
Do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ Do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ No , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . __eou__
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ No , really ? __eou__ Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ Who will be there ? __eou__ James is going to be packed off there . __eou__ That is good . He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? __eou__ Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . __eou__ Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? __eou__ No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? __eou__ I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . __eou__ All right ! Thanks ! __eou__
I immigrated here last year . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . __eou__
I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! __eou__ Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! __eou__
Isn't it a nice day ? __eou__ It really is . __eou__ It seems that it may rain today . __eou__ Hopefully it will . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I like how clear the sky gets after it rains . __eou__ I feel the same way . It smells so good after it rains . __eou__ I especially love the night air when it rains . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ The stars look so much closer after it rains . __eou__ I really want it to rain today . __eou__ Yeah , so do I . __eou__
What are you doing tomorrow ? __eou__ Nothing really . __eou__ Let's watch a movie or something . __eou__ What's on these days ? __eou__ I think they're playing Lord of the Rings __eou__ That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . __eou__ Where should we meet ? __eou__ How about at the subway entrance . __eou__ Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock . __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . __eou__ Wonderful ! __eou__
Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . __eou__ Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . __eou__ I don't see much difference , anyway . __eou__
Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? __eou__ Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening . __eou__ That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? __eou__ Okay , that ’ s fine . __eou__
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! __eou__ God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? __eou__ Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . __eou__ They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . __eou__ You'd better pay more attention to your health . __eou__ I will , thanks for your concern . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock . __eou__ What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... __eou__ I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . __eou__ I see . Where are you now , Li ? __eou__ Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . __eou__ It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? __eou__ I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! __eou__ That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock . __eou__ I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting . __eou__ It doesn't matter.Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets __eou__ All right . __eou__ Here is your ticket . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , let's go in . __eou__ It is a new park , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , how do you know ? __eou__ I guessed it . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . __eou__ Oh , how wonderful ! __eou__
OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . __eou__ You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . __eou__ Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . __eou__ You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . __eou__ The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! __eou__ Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . __eou__
Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yes . I miss you very much . __eou__ So do I . __eou__ Have you graduated from college ? __eou__ Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . __eou__ Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__ Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? __eou__ Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . __eou__ Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . __eou__ That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__ If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__
Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ How old is he today ? __eou__ It's his 50th birthday . __eou__ Well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? __eou__ I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . __eou__ Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . __eou__ Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . __eou__ Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . __eou__ Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? __eou__ Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . __eou__ Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . __eou__ Say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ Likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ? __eou__ Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ? __eou__ Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else . __eou__ That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . __eou__ I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed . __eou__ Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . __eou__
Are you doing anything tonight ? __eou__ No , nothing . Why ? __eou__ Do you like western music ? __eou__ Yes , I do , very much . __eou__ There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . __eou__
can I use your laptop for a while ? __eou__ sure , go ahead . __eou__ oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? __eou__ yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . __eou__ oh my , no internet access is killing me . __eou__ can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . __eou__ no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . __eou__ now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . __eou__ what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . __eou__ well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ then , you're probably addicted . __eou__
That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? __eou__ Of course . I always keep what I catch . __eou__ Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . __eou__ If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . __eou__ Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__
Did you watch the Premiership last night ? __eou__ Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . __eou__ No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . __eou__ Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . __eou__ Which team do you back then ? __eou__ I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . __eou__ But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . __eou__
Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? __eou__ Yeah . Whatever became of him ? __eou__ He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . __eou__ That's great . We should visit him some time . __eou__
You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__ So you are . __eou__ And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__ I feel exactly the same way with you . __eou__ Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . __eou__ What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . __eou__ You don ’ t love me ? __eou__ No . __eou__ But we ’ re so right for each other . __eou__ I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . __eou__
To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! __eou__ He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . __eou__ Galileo is one of them . __eou__ So are Copernicus and many others . __eou__
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... __eou__
It's said that John's broken up . __eou__ Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ I hear that John's leading a double wife . __eou__ It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Canada . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . __eou__ No , thanks all the same . __eou__ Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I really had a good time . __eou__ Well , thank you for coming . __eou__ So see you . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? __eou__ We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . __eou__ Which resources do you have to import ? __eou__ We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . __eou__ I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . __eou__ If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . __eou__ Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__

how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__
I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__ I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . __eou__ I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__ I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__ That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__ Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk . __eou__

He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__ you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__ well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__ did you tell him ? __eou__ yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__ you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__ I know .

Not my Dad , I hope ! ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . __eou__ No kidding ! Jack is such a log !

But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__

Anything else ? __eou__ How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . __eou__ You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You're all the same . __eou__
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . __eou__ But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? __eou__ Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ What happens then ? __eou__ Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . __eou__ I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__
How do you like these dishes ? __eou__ Fine , they are colorful and tasty . __eou__ Did you enjoy your dinner ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . __eou__ Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full . __eou__ Another piece of meat pie ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm on diet . __eou__ How about the dessert ? __eou__ Ice cream , please . __eou__
how do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ do you have a car ? __eou__ no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ you could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__
I will take part in the finals soon . __eou__ Come on . I stand behind you . __eou__
Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ? __eou__ Yes , he is . __eou__
Did you go to school today ? __eou__ Of course . Did you ? __eou__ I didn't want to , so I didn't . __eou__ That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? __eou__ That's a switch . __eou__ I'm serious , have you ? __eou__ No , I haven't . Why ? __eou__ I really want to go to the movies this weekend . __eou__ So go then . __eou__ I really don't want to go by myself . __eou__ Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I think I'm going to go to the movies . __eou__
How's your work ? __eou__ Good , thanks . How about you ? __eou__ Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because of the low salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? __eou__ I don't know why . __eou__ Why don't you give them a suggestion ? __eou__ May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . __eou__
I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike . __eou__ That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot . __eou__ Well , I wish you good luck ! __eou__
Why are you going out with Andy ? __eou__ Because I like him . __eou__ Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . __eou__
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . __eou__
Could you tell me the right time , please ? __eou__ Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . __eou__ You'll have to get it fixed . __eou__ Yes , I will . __eou__
Honey , how is by you ? __eou__ Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . __eou__
Dad , where are we off to ? __eou__ First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink ? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . __eou__ Good . I will have hot chocolate . __eou__ A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . __eou__ Sorry . How far is the museum ? __eou__ I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . __eou__ Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . __eou__
I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . __eou__ Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . __eou__ Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . __eou__ Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . __eou__ No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! __eou__
To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! __eou__ He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . __eou__ Galileo is one of them . __eou__ So are Copernicus and many others . __eou__
Do you think you'll get the project ? __eou__ It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . __eou__ I see.After all , he's boss's son . __eou__ But anyway , I'll have a try . __eou__
Thanks for coming to see me today . __eou__ It's no problem . I was really missing you anyway . __eou__ I missed you too . __eou__ Why haven't you tried to come see me then ? __eou__ I've been really busy . __eou__ Doing what ? __eou__ Working . __eou__ I would've come to see you sooner , but I've been busy too . __eou__ What have you been doing ? __eou__ I've been working too . __eou__ Well regardless , I'm very happy that you came to see me . __eou__ I am too . __eou__
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? __eou__ I had to look after my son at home . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a fever . __eou__ Is he getting better now ? __eou__ I think so.Thank you . __eou__
It's terrible how things have changed . You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . __eou__ Really ? There aren't many left now . __eou__ No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . __eou__ Were there any animals in the forest ? __eou__ Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . __eou__
What's wrong , Bob ? __eou__ I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? __eou__ Of course , I will . __eou__ That's great . I'll pick you up at eight . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
What's that , a new video game ? __eou__ Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . __eou__ For instance ? __eou__ It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . __eou__ Wow ! Anything else ? __eou__ This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . __eou__ What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? __eou__ Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! __eou__
Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . __eou__ Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? __eou__ That's what I'm wondering , too . __eou__ I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . __eou__
Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? __eou__ Sounds good . What should we see ? __eou__ How about that European movie ? __eou__ You mean the one starring John Travolta ? __eou__ Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . __eou__ Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . __eou__ Okay , see you then . __eou__
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform cannot be carried out well . __eou__ Government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
Do you often do exercise ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? __eou__ I often play badminton with my parents . __eou__ You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . __eou__ Hey , I'm good at playing it . __eou__ Says who ? __eou__ My parents . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ How about you , Daniel ? __eou__ I'm a real man , and I like football . __eou__ Well , who is your favorite football player ? __eou__ I like Renaldo the most . __eou__
We're thinking about going to America . __eou__ Have you thought about the cost ? __eou__ There is that . __eou__ I believe it'll be very expensive . __eou__
Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! __eou__ I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . __eou__
Our national economy is increasing hand over fist . __eou__ That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . __eou__ I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . __eou__
I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . __eou__ I thought you were going to let it grow out long . __eou__ I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . __eou__ You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . __eou__ Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . __eou__ Have you thought about wearing a hat ? __eou__ Everywhere I go ? __eou__ Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! __eou__
Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . __eou__ Thank you . My husband gave it to me . __eou__ Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . __eou__ Yes I am . I got married five years ago . __eou__ Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? __eou__ No , we met at university . __eou__
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__
Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? __eou__ Just so-so . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! __eou__ I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . __eou__
What's the weather like ? __eou__ I don't know . I just woke up . __eou__ Why don't you look outside ? __eou__ Okay . It looks like rain . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The sky is gray . __eou__ Is it raining right now ? __eou__ No . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The street isn't wet . __eou__ I have to go shopping today . __eou__ You'd better take an umbrella . __eou__
Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself . It was really fun ! __eou__ Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... __eou__ Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world . __eou__ Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home . __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ yes , I am the guy . __eou__ what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ how dare you ! __eou__ hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
Hi , Lucy ! __eou__ Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , It's very great . __eou__ Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? __eou__ You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . __eou__ Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . __eou__ Oh , I'll try to catch it . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth . __eou__ Take it easy . It ’ s no good worrying . You were on your last leg if you keep worrying in this way . __eou__
Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ’ t anybody home . __eou__ We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks . __eou__ How ’ d it go ? Did we win ? __eou__ Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game . __eou__
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? __eou__ I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . __eou__ Where did you spend your holiday ? __eou__ I went to Paris . __eou__
Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall . __eou__ Yeah , I've been there twice . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ? __eou__ Oh , it's fantastic . __eou__ Where did you go ? __eou__ On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto . __eou__ What did you think of Tokyo ? __eou__ Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too . __eou__ Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds ! __eou__ And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive . __eou__ And how about Kyoto ? __eou__ Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city . __eou__ How was the weather ? __eou__ I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . __eou__ Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! __eou__
But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . __eou__ I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . __eou__ That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . __eou__
Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? __eou__ It's fine with me . __eou__
Would you like some more coffee ? __eou__ No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ The waitress is bringing the bill right now . __eou__ This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? __eou__ Yes , this waitress did a great job . __eou__ OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . __eou__ What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? __eou__ Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? __eou__ Yes , 20 % would be perfect . __eou__ Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! __eou__ I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . __eou__
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? __eou__ Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . __eou__ Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . __eou__ Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... __eou__ Is everything ready now ? __eou__ Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
We're lucky today . __eou__ Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace __eou__ Where's Hyde Park ? __eou__ It's on the other side of the Palace . __eou__ That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen . __eou__ Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there . __eou__ Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today . __eou__ Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating . __eou__
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . __eou__
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . __eou__ Did she mention anything else ? __eou__ No , nothing else . See you Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . __eou__ He is the guy I was telling you about . __eou__
I want to try my hand at the stocks . __eou__ It is very hard , you know . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day ? __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the 5 thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . __eou__
Shogun Restaurant of Pasadena . __eou__ Hi , could you help me ? I need to make a dinner reservation . __eou__ I can help you if you can just tell me what evening you like the reservation for . __eou__ Tuesday night is when we need the reservation for . __eou__ What time do you think that you would like to have dinner ? __eou__ 7 __eou__ How many diners will be in your group ? __eou__ We need a reservation for four . __eou__ I have a table for four available at 7 __eou__ My last name is Foster . Thank you for the reservation . __eou__ Mr . Foster , we will be expecting you this Tuesday at 7 __eou__ We will be there ! Thanks for the help ! __eou__
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . __eou__
Hi . are you new here ? __eou__ Yes . I moved here last week . __eou__ I'm Steven , your neighbour . __eou__ I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . __eou__ I guess so .

It is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__ No , it's a semimonthly . __eou__ Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__ Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__ Oh , I think I should try to read one . __eou__

Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? __eou__ Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . __eou__ Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . __eou__

I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ You really can't live without candy . __eou__

Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . __eou__ You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? __eou__ Actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__ You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . __eou__ That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__ The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__ Probably you ’ re right . __eou__
Look at the cloud . __eou__ It's going to rain . __eou__ Let's go quickly . __eou__
Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . __eou__ Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? __eou__ Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? __eou__ You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . __eou__
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__ Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__ Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__ Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__ Yeah , it sure would . __eou__
Let's go eat . __eou__ 0kay . Dinner's on me . __eou__
Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? __eou__ No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . __eou__ Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . __eou__ They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . __eou__ Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? __eou__ I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . __eou__ Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__
Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? __eou__ Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . __eou__ You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . __eou__

What is the bridemaid's name ? __eou__ Judy , Why are you so interested in her ? __eou__ Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman __eou__ He's terribly handsome . __eou__ I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive . __eou__ Why are you so bitter ?

Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ Oh , really ? How does the book end ? __eou__ Read it yourself and find out ! __eou__

What do you recommend ? __eou__ More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? __eou__ Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ I can so that . __eou__ Here is a free class going on right over there .

Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? __eou__ That's because Americans love sitcoms . __eou__ Sitcoms ? __eou__ Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . __eou__ In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . __eou__ I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . __eou__
I don ’ t dare to look after the children now . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . __eou__ It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . __eou__

I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__

What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__

I've seen him a couple of times , I think . __eou__
What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . __eou__ Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . __eou__ Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . __eou__ Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor .

Do you think people actually like them ? __eou__ I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . __eou__ But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . __eou__ Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . __eou__ Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? __eou__ Not well enough , but I'm learning . __eou__
Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl ! __eou__ Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ? __eou__ We ’ Ve named her Alice after my wife ’ s grandmother . __eou__ That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! __eou__
I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ? __eou__ Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__ Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . __eou__ Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! __eou__
Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . __eou__ And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . __eou__ The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . __eou__ Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? __eou__ Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . __eou__
Excuse me , miss . I'm Bob . __eou__ I'm Amy . How do you do ? __eou__ I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ? __eou__ Certainly ! I suppose you dance often . __eou__ No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ? __eou__ Yes , I'm glad I have come . __eou__ How do you like fox-trot ? __eou__ I like it very much . __eou__ You dance beautifully . __eou__ Thank you . It's lucky that I have got a good partner . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I'm really mad at Bob . __eou__ What for ? ( Why ? ) __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is Thursday . __eou__ What's the date today ? __eou__ Today is May first , 2003 . __eou__ Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? __eou__ Well , I don't think so . __eou__
what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t __eou__ that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! __eou__
Good morning , Sue . __eou__ Good morning , Tom.How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? __eou__ Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ? __eou__ I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . __eou__ See you later , alligator . __eou__ After a while , crocodile . __eou__
Where are we headed now ? __eou__ To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . __eou__ Awesome . Was someone killed there ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . __eou__ Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . __eou__
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . __eou__ What's the route ? __eou__ From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . __eou__ If only I could join it ! __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Guangzhou . __eou__ Where in China is Guangzhou ? __eou__ It's in the South of China . __eou__
The Canada Day is on the 1st of July . __eou__ What is its national anthem ? __eou__ The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' . __eou__ Can you sing the song ? __eou__ Yes , I could sing it when I was very young . __eou__
Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . __eou__ Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane . __eou__ No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? __eou__ Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . __eou__ All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . __eou__ Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . __eou__ No , before the In dynasty . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . __eou__ Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . __eou__
Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . __eou__ Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . __eou__ But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . __eou__ I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Vicky . __eou__ Are you there yet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late . __eou__ That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ On the second floor . __eou__ Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? __eou__ Come upstairs . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor . __eou__ Oh , OK . What are you doing there ? __eou__ Just looking at some books on how to learn English . __eou__ Do you want to get something to eat later ? __eou__ No , I'm still full from dinner . __eou__ What do you want to do ? __eou__ I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it . __eou__ OK , see you soon . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? __eou__ Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . __eou__ Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . __eou__ That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . __eou__ You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . __eou__ Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it . __eou__
Hello Michael . __eou__ Hello Todd . __eou__ We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? __eou__ Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__
Are you coming or not ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Well , make up your mind . We need to know . __eou__ Ok , count me in . __eou__
I hear you and James are engaged at last . __eou__ Yes , we are . __eou__ When are you getting married ? __eou__ In the spring . __eou__ Oh , lovely.Where ' s the wedding going to be ? __eou__ Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . __eou__ Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Where are you going to live after you're married ? __eou__ We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . __eou__ Are you going to give up your job ? __eou__ Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . __eou__
It was good to see you here , John . __eou__ Happy to see you-too-Mike.How ' s your family ? __eou__ Pretty good.Thank you . __eou__
I hear that Mary got mad . __eou__ So I heard . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with her ? __eou__ She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . __eou__
Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . __eou__ Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . __eou__ It isn't Elvin . __eou__ Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . __eou__ Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . __eou__
Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . __eou__ We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . __eou__ Out ? What do you mean out ? __eou__ You know on a date , they are going to dinner . __eou__ Dad and mom ? __eou__ Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . __eou__ You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? __eou__ That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? __eou__
Harry , do you like the opera ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ Why is that ? It is called real art . __eou__ Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__ Yeah , that makes sense . __eou__
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it ’ s formal . __eou__ Then , you should dress well . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . __eou__ You are smart . __eou__ Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . __eou__ You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . __eou__ Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? __eou__ It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a teacher . __eou__
Do you like Barry ? __eou__ No , not very much . He ’ s too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__ I agree . I like his brother , Paul . They are not alike . __eou__ Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__ What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I ’ m polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t think you ’ re shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I ’ m not as shy as I think . Anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__
Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? __eou__ I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird . __eou__ I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ? __eou__ Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
Let's get together this weekend . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
I want to leave the motorbike outdoors . __eou__ Fine , just don't do it at night . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ The cold weather will damage the engine . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . __eou__ Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? __eou__ Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? __eou__ I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . __eou__ When can you come ? __eou__ I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . __eou__
Have you heard we'll have a pay rise ? __eou__ Oh , it has nothing to do with me . __eou__ It's a pity , but why ? __eou__ I came here only a month ago . __eou__
I often go to a place of leisure . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . __eou__ Sounds great . __eou__ The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . __eou__ How nice . __eou__ I may take you there some day . __eou__ Good . __eou__
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__ Yes . I like it very much . __eou__ Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__ It's excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__ What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? __eou__ I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__
You look upset , is there anything wrong ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! __eou__ Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . __eou__
What's up ? __eou__ Nothing , how about you ? __eou__ Next Saturday , I'm going to have a party . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ You are coming ? __eou__ Probably not . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I don't feel like going . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I really can't stand going to parties . __eou__ I understand , I guess . __eou__ Sorry about that . __eou__
Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . __eou__ But , Bob , we were so good together . __eou__ I'm sorry but it's for the best . __eou__ I don't understand . We were getting along so well . __eou__
Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? __eou__ Sounds good , when ? __eou__ When is it convenient for you ? __eou__ Any time is fine . __eou__ Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? __eou__ Please wait for us even if we're a little late . __eou__ Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ OK . Bye ! __eou__
Hello , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? __eou__ I was almost on line the whole night . __eou__ Did you play network games the whole night ? __eou__ No , I listened to the music , too . __eou__ What are you going to do now ? __eou__ I'm tired . I need a rest . __eou__
Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . __eou__ Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . __eou__ He seems to win awards everywhere . __eou__ He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . __eou__ I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' __eou__ That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__ No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__ I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
What a surprise we've met here ! __eou__ Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ? __eou__ I've been in China.Where were you ? __eou__ In Thailand . I taught English there . __eou__
Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? __eou__ How about Great Canyon ? __eou__ Is it worth seeing ? __eou__ Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . __eou__
I can't believe it ! I lost . __eou__ It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! __eou__ That's not fair , you got all the easy questions . __eou__ I guess that's just the luck of the draw . __eou__ I want a rematch . Let's play again . __eou__ Sorry , not tonight ! __eou__
How about going swimming ? __eou__ Ok . Where should we go ? __eou__ Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . __eou__
Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ No . what's it like ? __eou__ It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! __eou__ Would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . __eou__ What's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England . __eou__ Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job . __eou__
How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . __eou__ How do you do ? Mr . Barker . __eou__ Parker . __eou__ Oh , Parker with a P ? __eou__ Yes , with a P . __eou__ Er ... I ’ m Barker . __eou__ Barker ? With a B . Of course . __eou__ Yes , with a B . __eou__ Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Parker . __eou__
I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? __eou__ I want to have a foot massage and haircut . __eou__ A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . __eou__ Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . __eou__ This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! __eou__ I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__ Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__ Maybe we should try a thai massage too . __eou__ What ’ s special about a thai massage ? __eou__ That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . __eou__ Sounds painful ! __eou__
Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I really like it here . __eou__ Would you like to do something tonight ? __eou__ Sure . I'd love to . __eou__ Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ? __eou__ Yes . I've already been to several clubs here . __eou__ OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ? __eou__ Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week . __eou__ So , what do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time . __eou__ Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . __eou__ Great ! Let's make a reservation . __eou__
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ That ’ s sounds great . __eou__ Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ No . I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__
In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? __eou__ Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . __eou__ Is this your best score ? __eou__ No , once I did 32 . __eou__
Jane is going to quit her job in the bank . __eou__ You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . __eou__ It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . __eou__
Lisa , I'm home . __eou__ How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . __eou__ Anybody I know ? __eou__ Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? __eou__ Of course . You didn't have to ask me . __eou__ That's what Pam said . __eou__ Just don't stay out too late . __eou__
Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . __eou__ I've said you will enjoy your life here ! __eou__ I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . __eou__ My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__ Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . __eou__ He performs very well . He is so funny ! __eou__ OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! __eou__ OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . __eou__ OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! __eou__
How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ? __eou__ I will take a rain check . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__ I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one . __eou__ No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that . __eou__
David , what have you been up to lately ? __eou__ I went on a trip with my family last week . __eou__ Really ? Where did you go ? __eou__ We went to Europe . __eou__ What cities did you go to ? __eou__ London , Paris and a few other cities . __eou__ Did you go to Berlin ? __eou__ No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . __eou__ I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . __eou__ That's what I've heard . __eou__ I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . __eou__ That's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . __eou__
OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . __eou__ Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? __eou__ Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . __eou__
I think it's about time that we had to go . __eou__ What ? Won't you have more drinks ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . __eou__ Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . __eou__ Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . __eou__ Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free . __eou__
So , John , what do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . __eou__ Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? __eou__ Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . __eou__ Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? __eou__ About two years now . __eou__
I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . __eou__ David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . __eou__ What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? __eou__ It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . __eou__ It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . __eou__ No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . __eou__ Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . __eou__ I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? __eou__ People think it's funny . __eou__
What happened ? Why didn't he win ? __eou__ Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . __eou__ How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ Let's hope so . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ Er ... no , go ahead . __eou__ You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang . __eou__ Happy to know you , Tim . __eou__
What are you using for bait today ? __eou__ We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . __eou__ Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . __eou__ Looks like a lucky day for everyone . __eou__
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither.The game ended in two all . __eou__ But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . __eou__ But the Brazilian is tougher . __eou__
Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . __eou__ But he seems to be very happy with Rose . __eou__ He is more nice than wise . __eou__
I'd like to meet you again sometime . __eou__ That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . __eou__ Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon __eou__ Bye , Jason . __eou__
Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . __eou__ Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . __eou__ You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? __eou__ No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . __eou__ Do you ever get lonely living alone ? __eou__ Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! __eou__
How's your girlfriend ? __eou__ We broke up . __eou__
I'm going on a cruise this summer . __eou__ No kidding ? __eou__ My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . __eou__ You can't beat that . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__ Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! __eou__ Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . __eou__ Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? __eou__ Maybe ... __eou__ Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . __eou__ Is that a kind of alcohol ? __eou__ It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! __eou__ Great . My face will turn even redder ! __eou__
What's today's date ? __eou__ It's January . __eou__
Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye __eou__ Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . __eou__ I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ You are something else you know that ? __eou__
What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? __eou__ Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . __eou__ The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... __eou__ And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! __eou__ You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? __eou__
Do you want to hear a funny joke ? __eou__ OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? __eou__ Well , you'll see . __eou__ OK . __eou__ OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . __eou__ I see . __eou__ So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . __eou__ Oh , that's funny ! __eou__ Hang on , I haven't finished yet . __eou__ Oh , sorry . __eou__ Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . __eou__ A car door ? You mean just one car door ? __eou__ Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__
Let's take a coffee break , shall we ? __eou__ I wish I could , but I can't . __eou__ What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever . __eou__ Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . __eou__ I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . __eou__
I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__
People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? __eou__ Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ Then what are the Westerners fit for ? __eou__ I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . __eou__
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? __eou__ Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? __eou__ Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . __eou__ Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . __eou__ Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? __eou__ For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . __eou__ Hey , young man , you are so deep today . __eou__ I always am . You just didn't notice . __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . __eou__ I usually play with my schoolmates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . __eou__ Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . __eou__ Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? __eou__ It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? __eou__ I am leaving in two weeks . __eou__ So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? __eou__ 7 is fine with me . __eou__ Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . __eou__ I'll be waiting . __eou__
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ That ’ s sounds great . __eou__ Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ No . I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__
Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . __eou__ Really ? When did that happen ? __eou__ A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . __eou__
Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . __eou__ Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever . __eou__
Do you know his sister ? __eou__ Her name is Laura , isn't it ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . __eou__ What does she look like ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Pretty , is she ? __eou__ Yes ... quite pretty . __eou__
A new film is on . Have you ever seen it ? __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? __eou__ It's a feature film . __eou__ Oh , I've no interest in such films . __eou__
Could you tell me the right time , please ? __eou__ Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days . __eou__ You have to go and fix it . __eou__ Yes . I will . __eou__
Hi , David ! What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? __eou__ Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... __eou__ Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . __eou__ Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . __eou__ Well ... What are you interested in ? __eou__ How about the Classical Music Club ? __eou__ Joanna , give me a break . __eou__ Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? __eou__ Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! __eou__
Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? __eou__ nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . __eou__ Are you sure you cann't remember ? __eou__ I've absolutely certain . __eou__ Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? __eou__ I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . __eou__ Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Quite sure . __eou__
I can't believe how hot it is . __eou__ It's not even noon yet . __eou__ That means it will get hotter . __eou__ I am dying from the heat . __eou__ Turn on the air conditioner . __eou__ It doesn't work . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Did you call the repairman ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ When is he coming ? __eou__ He's busy . He said next week . __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ really ? Is he married ? __eou__ no , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ office romance is very tricky . __eou__ it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__ I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__ And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . __eou__ No , I wouldn't think so . __eou__ I do wish I could lose weight . __eou__ Well , why don't you go on the diet ? __eou__ I've tried diets before but they've never worked . __eou__ Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should . __eou__
Thanks for everything . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? __eou__ I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks so much . __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? __eou__ It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . __eou__ No , thanks all the same . __eou__ Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . We really had a good time . __eou__ Well . Thank you for coming . __eou__ So see you . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . __eou__ You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . __eou__ Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? __eou__ Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . __eou__ All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . __eou__ Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! __eou__ Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? __eou__ It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! __eou__
I want to say goodbye to everyone . __eou__ You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? __eou__ I ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning . __eou__ How about I come and see you off ? __eou__ You really don ’ t need to . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__ Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . __eou__ Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . __eou__ Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . __eou__
Well , I've got to go . See you later . __eou__ See you . Have a nice day ! __eou__ Thanks , you too . __eou__
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! __eou__

I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . __eou__
Mum , this is for you . __eou__ Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? __eou__ Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! __eou__ Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! __eou__

Ok , and you know what comes on next ? __eou__ I believe there ’ s a sitcom . __eou__ Are you interested in watching it ? __eou__ Let me look in the TV Guide first . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ? __eou__ If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show . __eou__ Do you want to watch it ? __eou__ Let's watch it together . __eou__
I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting . __eou__ Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him . __eou__ Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . __eou__

How old is Keith ? __eou__ He's 21 . How old is James ? __eou__ He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . __eou__ How's your father ? __eou__ He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__ How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ In the same way , probably . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
How are you going all these days ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ But you look depressed . __eou__ I have some problem with my work . __eou__ Is it serious ? __eou__ I can solve it , thanks . __eou__ How about your family ? __eou__ Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . __eou__
I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . __eou__ What's he like ? __eou__ Oh , he's a very serious person . __eou__ You must feel very uneasy at his home . __eou__
hello . Where are you headed today ? __eou__ I'm off to Barcelona for a week . __eou__ do you have your passport with you ? __eou__ yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? __eou__ fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . __eou__ that's good advice . __eou__ would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? __eou__ let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__ ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__ alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? __eou__ I like to travel light so I just have this one . __eou__ if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__ yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? __eou__ you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! __eou__
So , did you go out with Richard ? __eou__ Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . __eou__ Did you like it ? __eou__ Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . __eou__ Yeah . So did you do anything else ? __eou__ Well , we went to a dance club . __eou__ Did you have fun there ? __eou__ Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__ Come on ! It is really a fun game . __eou__
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . __eou__ It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? __eou__ Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . __eou__ Wow , I doubt that . __eou__
I just got sacked . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
Have you been to Shanghai before ? __eou__ Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . __eou__ That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? __eou__ No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . __eou__ So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! __eou__
We're going dancing tonight . __eou__ Count me out . __eou__
I went to the doctor yesterday . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I said I had been to the doctor the day before . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said I ' d got the flu . __eou__ Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? __eou__ He told me to stay in bed for ten days . __eou__ Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? __eou__ Yes , ten days . __eou__
Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? __eou__ Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . __eou__ Are you from Italy , Christina ? __eou__ No , I am German . I live in Munich . __eou__ Really , I went to Munich last week . __eou__ And did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . __eou__ And where are you from , Jack ? __eou__ I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . __eou__ What are you studying ? __eou__ I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . __eou__ Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__ How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__ OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__ Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . __eou__ Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . __eou__ A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . __eou__
I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ? __eou__ Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . ' __eou__ You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh . __eou__ I like horror movies because I like to be scared . __eou__
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . __eou__ Just because he gets on well with everybody ? __eou__ Partly , and he's also a hard working man . __eou__
How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? __eou__ You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . __eou__ In what ? __eou__ In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! __eou__ Can you do the vault ? __eou__ I do back flips at the pool all the time . __eou__
John got a heart attack last night . __eou__ Oh really ? Is he all right ? __eou__ Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . __eou__ Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . __eou__
What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . __eou__ Do you mind if I come along sometime ? __eou__ No , not at all . Glad to have you . __eou__
Did you enjoy the restaurant ? __eou__ I didn't really like it all that much . __eou__ What do you think the problem was ? __eou__ Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet . __eou__ How did you feel about the food ? __eou__ The food wasn't all that exciting . __eou__ I don't think that the service was good , either . __eou__ Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience . __eou__ Would you like to return to this restaurant ? __eou__ Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down . __eou__
Hey , the pool's open now ! __eou__ As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . __eou__ So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... __eou__ ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . __eou__ Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . __eou__ That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! __eou__
What's your weight ? __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ I can't bear eating less . __eou__
There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? __eou__ I haven't seen her yet . __eou__ I think that she is very pretty . __eou__ Tell me how she looks . __eou__ She's kind of short . __eou__ What height is she ? __eou__ She's probably about five feet . __eou__ That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . __eou__ The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . __eou__ I think I might've bumped into her before . __eou__ Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? __eou__ I believe so . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ Yeah , you can count on it . __eou__ I think so . Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him . He's good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__
Would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . __eou__ The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak . __eou__ I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . __eou__ Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . __eou__ Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much money should we leave for a tip ? __eou__ I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ? __eou__ She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip . __eou__ So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , what a wonderful meal ! __eou__ It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime . __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though . __eou__
Jane , pleases come with us . __eou__ I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . __eou__ Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? __eou__ Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . __eou__ But ... OK . __eou__
Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . __eou__ Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? __eou__ Manchester United . What about you ? __eou__ Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? __eou__ I have confidence in them . __eou__
Is your city a historical place ? __eou__ Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . __eou__ How did it grow into such a large place ? __eou__ Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . __eou__ As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . __eou__ Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . __eou__ I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . __eou__ Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . __eou__
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking again yet ? __eou__ not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? __eou__ Well , I like to play the piano . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? __eou__ About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . __eou__ That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . __eou__ Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? __eou__ No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . __eou__
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? __eou__ Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . __eou__ Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . __eou__ Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . __eou__ Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! __eou__
Have you ever been to Britain ? __eou__ Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . __eou__ Really ? How often do you go there ? __eou__ Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . __eou__ Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business . __eou__
I plan to emigrate to Canada . __eou__ Have you found a suitable job ? __eou__ No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good . __eou__ But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing . __eou__ Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . __eou__
Are you going to take the job ? __eou__ I'll have to sleep on it . __eou__
And what's your vision ? __eou__ 20/350 . __eou__ Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... __eou__ They don't have toilets at the campground ? __eou__ Let's just say I'll have it easy ... __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__
Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? __eou__ Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . __eou__ Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? __eou__ Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? __eou__ What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? __eou__ No , do you want to go and do something ? __eou__ Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . __eou__ Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? __eou__
Does your chicken taste all right ? __eou__ The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ? __eou__ My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . __eou__ It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . __eou__ Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__ Are your vegetables a little mushy ? __eou__ The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . __eou__ Mine aren't so good , either . __eou__ I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . __eou__ I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem . __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work hard . __eou__
How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? __eou__ I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! __eou__

Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . __eou__ Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . __eou__ I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . __eou__ I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . __eou__ It must have really hurt afterwards . __eou__ Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . __eou__ I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . __eou__ I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! __eou__ Is there any pain now ? __eou__ No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . __eou__ Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . __eou__
I just won the lottery . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__
Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . __eou__ Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? __eou__ I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! __eou__ That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . __eou__
You look run down , Brian . __eou__ I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . __eou__ Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . __eou__ I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
How often do you use the internet ? __eou__ I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . __eou__
Good evening , sir .

Let's go for a drink after work . __eou__ Nothing doing . __eou__
Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? __eou__ Do you mean lying to people for their good ? __eou__ Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? __eou__ It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . __eou__ But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . __eou__ I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . __eou__

It's so nice of you to comfort me . __eou__
Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian . __eou__ You did ? that is great ! __eou__ Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? __eou__ No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? __eou__ Around seven . __eou__ Ok , great , should I bring anything ? __eou__ No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? __eou__ sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? __eou__ Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . __eou__ Got it . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . __eou__ You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain . __eou__ Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . __eou__ You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . __eou__ No wonder people say __eou__ Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky ! __eou__ I didn't know you liked bird-watching . __eou__ I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . __eou__
I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . __eou__ Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__ All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! __eou__ Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . __eou__ But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . __eou__
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? __eou__ Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? __eou__ Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . __eou__ Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . __eou__
What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ? __eou__ I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's . don't you agree ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid not . I think the hero has much more to be believed in . __eou__
Good to see you . Come on in . __eou__ Thank you . Here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . __eou__
Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . __eou__ Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . __eou__ I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? __eou__ They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . __eou__ Let's go . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ? __eou__ Yes , I am . What's up ? __eou__ Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? __eou__ With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . __eou__ Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . __eou__ But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? __eou__ No . Just occasionally . __eou__ What's your favorite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz . __eou__ How about rock'n'roll ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy . __eou__ And the tango ? __eou__ Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . __eou__ Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then . __eou__
So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? __eou__ No , I first came here 1995 . __eou__ Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? __eou__ Well , I am from Canada . Actually . __eou__ Oh , I am so sorry . __eou__ That ' ok . That's happens all the time . __eou__
I told you that she is no fool . __eou__ I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . __eou__ But most bosses are fools for woman . __eou__
I have been feeling sick for three days . __eou__ I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? __eou__ Not much better.Thank you . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Haven't seen you for a long time __eou__ I've been away on a vacation . __eou__ I bet you had a wonderful time __eou__ Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends __eou__ Sounds great __eou__
Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? __eou__ Why not . If I were you , I certainly would . __eou__ But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time . __eou__ As the saying goes , work value work , play value play . All work and no play make a jucky-dull boy , you know . __eou__ Em , you ’ re right . __eou__
I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? __eou__ Perfect ! __eou__ Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . __eou__ Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Jones ! __eou__ Good morning , Miss Bell ! __eou__ Nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you too . It's been a long time . __eou__ How is everything ? __eou__ Just fine , and you ? __eou__ Quite well , thank you . __eou__ Did you drive yourself to the airport ? __eou__ No , I was driven by my husband . __eou__ Did someone meet you at the airport here ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . __eou__ Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? __eou__ No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . __eou__
Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... __eou__ Out of hand . __eou__ Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . __eou__ Where ’ d you meet him ? __eou__ Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... __eou__ About what ? __eou__ Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... __eou__
Which church do you attend ? __eou__ I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . __eou__ What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? __eou__ Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . __eou__ Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? __eou__ That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . __eou__ Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Why do you really go to church ? __eou__ We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . __eou__
Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . __eou__ Oh , that's good news for us . __eou__ So what do you provide ? __eou__ First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits . __eou__ How can you get that done ? __eou__ Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ? __eou__ That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . __eou__ Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . __eou__ That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__ Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__ Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . __eou__ I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . __eou__
What's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ In the summer it gets very hot . The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . When it is hot we often get rains . The winters are drier . __eou__ The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . The rain falls mostly in the winter . And we often get snow . __eou__ What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . I heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ We do have a few fog days in winter . But I would not say we have a lot of fogs . The sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are like I said we have thunderstorms . But each one usually last a few hours . Then the skys are clear again . __eou__ Have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . But my parents and I never see it outside of my city . __eou__ The river in my city sometime freeze over . People go ice-skating on it . In summer people go boating on the river . But few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . But people still go swimming all year around . I prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning . __eou__
In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . __eou__ Who do you think that has the motive ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . __eou__ OK , murder will out ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? __eou__ Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . __eou__ No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . __eou__ Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? __eou__ My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__ I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__ Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " __eou__ And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean " a loud train " ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? __eou__ I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ The Taj it is then . __eou__ Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ They'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__ Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . __eou__ No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . __eou__ I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__
Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . __eou__ Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . __eou__ Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . __eou__ There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__
You know John ? __eou__ Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . __eou__ I wish he could too . __eou__ How ’ s your boy , Jack ? __eou__ He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . __eou__ Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? __eou__ Good luck to them . __eou__
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . __eou__
Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? __eou__ You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . __eou__ Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? __eou__ Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__
Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . __eou__ Guess what ? He has just got the sack . __eou__ Oh , is that so ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . __eou__ It was a good thing I had enough on me . __eou__ Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back . __eou__
I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . __eou__ You mean you suspect him . __eou__ I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling . __eou__ I hope I can do something for you . __eou__
How long have you been living in New York ? __eou__ Oh , about two years now . __eou__ Where do your parents live ? __eou__ They still live in Shanghai where I was born . __eou__ Do you write or call them very much ? __eou__ Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? __eou__ Don't count on it . __eou__
This is my house.Let me show you around it . __eou__ How beautiful the detached house is ! __eou__ Follow me to the back-yard . __eou__ It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . __eou__ We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . __eou__ No wonder it smells fragrant . __eou__ Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . __eou__ It's fantastic ! __eou__
Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? __eou__ Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight . __eou__ When's the wedding going to be ? __eou__ We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know . __eou__ Are you having a big wedding ? __eou__ Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding . __eou__ But what do you say about that ? __eou__ I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ’ ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime . __eou__ Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before . __eou__
He has worked five years in that bank . __eou__ He must be an experienced accountant . __eou__ You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . __eou__ Great minds think alike . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . __eou__ ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . __eou__
Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
I'm so glad to meet you . __eou__ How is everything going on ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You look prettier than before . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . __eou__
Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? __eou__ Waiting for someone . __eou__ You mean the boy you met on MSN ? __eou__ You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__ You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__ Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__ Did you tell him ? __eou__ Yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__ You shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__ I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__ I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . __eou__
Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . __eou__ Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? __eou__
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? __eou__ No , it's the Japanese team . __eou__ Japanese teams always play a dark horse . __eou__ Well , their team work is well worth learning . __eou__
how did your interview go ? __eou__ pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ my boss . __eou__ what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do . __eou__
Are you have a hand in locking into the case ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How do you feel about it ? __eou__ It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . __eou__
I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? __eou__ Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . __eou__ Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . __eou__ Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? __eou__ Sure , more elegant and taller . __eou__ I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . __eou__ If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
It's awfully quiet around here . __eou__ Yeah . There's nobody in sight . __eou__ I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . __eou__ I think you're right . Let's go . __eou__
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__
What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? __eou__ Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . __eou__ Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . __eou__ I still think nobody plays for nothing . __eou__
Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ? __eou__ I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's __eou__ They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy . __eou__ That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ? __eou__ Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go __eou__ That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night . __eou__ Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too . __eou__ That does sound a lot of fun . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__ That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I stayed up all night writing a report . __eou__ Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . __eou__
Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! __eou__ Huh ? Me ? __eou__ Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . __eou__ Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? __eou__ Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . __eou__ Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . __eou__ It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! __eou__ Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . __eou__ Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . __eou__

She is a gem . __eou__ Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself . __eou__ Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ? __eou__ I've tried , but it didn't work . __eou__ So , when are you going to tell her ? __eou__ Maybe tonight . I don't know .

They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
Happy new year ! __eou__ Thank you . Same to you . __eou__ Have you got any plans ? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? __eou__ My roommate ’ s having a party . __eou__

I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__

Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . __eou__ Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . __eou__ Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . __eou__ Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . __eou__ You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? __eou__ They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . __eou__ Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? __eou__ Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . __eou__ Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? __eou__ It's possible . __eou__
Suit wrote me a letter . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . __eou__ It's not a surprise , is it ?

What are you listening now , Fred ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . __eou__ Jay Chou's title song in his new album . __eou__ What's your comment on his new album ? __eou__ Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . __eou__ Let me enjoy it . __eou__ I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . __eou__ I cann't wait for buying his CD now . __eou__
The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ? __eou__ Johnson ? I can't place them . __eou__ We met them in Bermuda last May . __eou__ They've completely slipped my mind . __eou__ The couple with the dogs , think back . __eou__ No , I don't recall a thing about them . __eou__ Well , I've invited them for brunch . __eou__ Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . __eou__
Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ? __eou__ Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for half a year . __eou__ That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__

There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? __eou__ We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . __eou__ So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . __eou__
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ?

I don't need any more sun-tan . __eou__ It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . __eou__ It might be good to you .

What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__

Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__
Can you believe me ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Please count on my love . __eou__ I will . __eou__ I'll be yours through endless time . __eou__ I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . __eou__ Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . __eou__ I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . __eou__ My love will grow , like a river to flow . __eou__ It can't be dry , and can't die . __eou__ I don't know whether we are in a dream . __eou__ Aha , Aha ... __eou__
Hello , Mr . Macmillan . __eou__ Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ? __eou__ Much better , thanks . __eou__ Glad to hear it . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it .

It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? __eou__ No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . __eou__ You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . __eou__ Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . __eou__
How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? __eou__ Seventy-six , I think . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? __eou__ I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ the Taj it is then . __eou__ shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ they'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__ are you sure ? We could go Dutch . __eou__ no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . __eou__ I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! __eou__
Martin . __eou__ Hi . John , it ’ s Emily . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Great , thanks . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ? __eou__
Brian , do you know how to speak English ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Where did you learn ? __eou__ I learned in college . __eou__ You speak really well . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How long have you been in the U . S . ? __eou__ 3 weeks . __eou__ Is your wife with you ? __eou__ Yes , she just got here yesterday . __eou__ Have you been to California before ? __eou__ No . I've never been there . __eou__ Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? __eou__ Yes . I went there once on a business trip . __eou__
Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? __eou__ Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . __eou__ He won the first place ! __eou__ Good boy ! __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ? __eou__ What time dose it start ? __eou__ In about 25 minutes . __eou__ Then we'd better get started . __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__
Leo ! I wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget . We ’ re having a get-together after work tonight at Carl ’ s Karaoke Club to celebrate having finished it . We ’ d love to see __eou__ What fun ! Normally I ’ d love to , but I ’ m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ’ Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King . __eou__ Oh , right . You ’ re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ? __eou__ Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . __eou__ Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
The boy threw up . __eou__ That's disgusting . __eou__
You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__ What ! __eou__
Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . __eou__ I'm glad I was able to help . __eou__ It's most kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . __eou__ If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I'm most grateful . __eou__ It was a pleasure . __eou__
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ Ok , then we can sign up for it together . __eou__
Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . __eou__ I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding . __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ Come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ But promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ Really ? Is he married ? __eou__ Bo , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ Then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ Office romance is very tricky . __eou__ It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__ I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . But I think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here I go ! __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
We must set 1000 dollars aside each month . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are going to buy our own house . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . __eou__ Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet . __eou__ You try to put on a brave face . __eou__
Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . __eou__ Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! __eou__
Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
Hello , Lily . __eou__ Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock . __eou__ When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left . __eou__ What would you like today ? __eou__ I ’ ll have the leg of lamb . __eou__ And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . __eou__
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__ I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . __eou__
I enjoyed talking to you . __eou__ I enjoyed talking to you too . __eou__ We should hang out some time . __eou__ I think that would be nice . __eou__ Is there anything you would like to do next time ? __eou__ Do you want to go out to eat ? __eou__ I'd like that . __eou__ So I'll see you next time . __eou__ I'm going to call you soon . __eou__ I'll talk to you later . __eou__ See you soon . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
How do you like waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice , I like it very much . __eou__ May I invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . __eou__ In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . __eou__ Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you like best ? __eou__ Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . __eou__ Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ? __eou__ Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . __eou__
What's your favorite season ? __eou__ I like the freedom of summer with no school . __eou__ Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . __eou__ And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . __eou__ Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... __eou__ And I really like the smells and colors of spring . __eou__ I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! __eou__ But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! __eou__
My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? __eou__ He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? __eou__ He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . __eou__ It must be hard being a father . __eou__ No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . __eou__ Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . __eou__
Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__ Are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__ Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . __eou__ You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . __eou__ Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? __eou__ Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . __eou__ So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? __eou__ Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . __eou__ If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . __eou__
Then I'll take them . How much ? __eou__ $ 120.The small gift box is complementary . __eou__ Here is $ 150.Keep the change . __eou__ Thank you ! Have a nice day ! __eou__ You too.Bye . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
It's a fine day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . __eou__ Yes . It's perfect . __eou__ And all of the flowers are in bloom . __eou__ I couldn't have asked for more . __eou__
What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? __eou__ To be honest , I wouldn't . __eou__ Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__ Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__ What's the puzzle ? __eou__ My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__ Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__ Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__ Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__ But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__ Definitely . __eou__ You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__ Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__ I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__ Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__
You look happy . __eou__ I am happy . I just bought a new car . __eou__ Wow ! Is it a good car ? __eou__ It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . __eou__ Was it expensive ? __eou__ Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . __eou__ What colour is it ? __eou__ It ’ s red and black . __eou__
Don't you have too much to do with him . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ His father is a prisoner . __eou__ So what ? His father is in prison , not he . __eou__
Hello , who is speaking ? __eou__ Hello , this is John . I want to speak to Linda . __eou__ This is her . __eou__ Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening . __eou__ Really ? What time and where ? __eou__ 7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride . __eou__ Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then . __eou__ See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale . __eou__ Thank you , see you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Can't you delay your return a little bit ? __eou__ No , I can't . I've really got important business . __eou__ Keep in touch then , OK ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Is your city a historical place ? __eou__ Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . __eou__ How did it grow into such a large place ? __eou__ Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . __eou__ As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . __eou__ Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . __eou__ I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . __eou__ Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . __eou__
I really like the record you lent me the other day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__ I'm glad . __eou__ Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? __eou__
Thank you . You do me a big favor . __eou__ That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . __eou__ It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . __eou__ Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . __eou__ Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . __eou__ Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__
That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . __eou__ We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . __eou__
Have a nice Thanksgiving ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you going anywhere ? __eou__ I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? __eou__ Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . __eou__
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ? __eou__ Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay . __eou__ Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . __eou__
Well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ And the people were so friendly ! __eou__ Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . __eou__ I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ If only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ Maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ Hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ Hey , what's the time ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . __eou__ Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . __eou__
Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . __eou__ I really couldn't understand him . __eou__ He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ We'd better leave him alone . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__ yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__ great , let's go ! __eou__ hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__ exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__ yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__ why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__ are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? __eou__ never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? __eou__ yeah , I think so . __eou__ ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__ wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . __eou__
What do you usually do in your work time ? __eou__ Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . __eou__ Are you usually busy ? __eou__ It depends . Sometimes I am very busy . __eou__ What depends ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . __eou__ But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . __eou__ The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . __eou__
Are you free tomorrow , Sam ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? __eou__
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . __eou__ Why don't you make up with John . __eou__ It's too late . __eou__
What was that all about ? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion . __eou__ Is she going to be okay ? __eou__ She'll be fine . __eou__
Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? __eou__ I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . __eou__ But I cannot forget him . __eou__
I've booked an air ticket to Venice . __eou__ How long will you be there ? __eou__ I'd like to stay there for a week . __eou__ So you'll have a tour of the famous city . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . __eou__ We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . __eou__
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . __eou__ Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . __eou__ So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . __eou__ Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? __eou__
Here comes the birthday cake . __eou__ Wow , what a lovely cake . __eou__ Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . __eou__ Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? __eou__ Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . __eou__ Better luck this time . __eou__
Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . __eou__ Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . __eou__ Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . __eou__ So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . __eou__ That's Madame Psychic to you . __eou__ I'm waiting ... __eou__ Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! __eou__
Good morning Mike ! __eou__ Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry ! __eou__ I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty . __eou__ Don't worry , I'll drive you . __eou__ Thank you very much ! __eou__ How are your cases coming along ? __eou__ Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it . __eou__ Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ? __eou__ Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much ! __eou__ You're welcome.Good luck , bye ! __eou__ Have a nice day , bye ! __eou__
In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? __eou__ The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . __eou__ Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? __eou__ They usually do . __eou__
How's the weather today ? __eou__ It's cloudy . __eou__ Is it going to rain today ? __eou__ I doubt it . __eou__ But I heard it might rain . __eou__
Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot . __eou__ It ’ s true . You should be happy about that . __eou__
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
It is really exciting news . __eou__ What news ? __eou__ You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ You know what we will get ? __eou__ We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ What docking station ? __eou__ This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . __eou__
It seems that many boys are fighting there . __eou__ Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? __eou__ No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . __eou__ Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . __eou__
Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? __eou__ To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . __eou__ Do you mean you got a divorce ? __eou__ Yes , my first marriage was a failure . __eou__
I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . __eou__ Great minds think alike . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? __eou__ I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . __eou__ That's too bad . What happened ? __eou__ Well ... that's a long story . __eou__
Can you imagine having a million dollars ? __eou__ Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__ A new car for a start . __eou__
Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here ! __eou__ Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? __eou__ Fine . How is Jim ? __eou__ Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time . __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
Any plans tonight ? __eou__ Not really , do you ? __eou__ Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__ Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . __eou__ That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? __eou__ Just did my best . __eou__
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Did you like the play ? __eou__ Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__
Are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . __eou__ What research ? __eou__ Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? __eou__ But they're just ads ... __eou__ Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ... __eou__
Good morning , Miss Li . __eou__ Morning , Mike . __eou__ I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . __eou__ I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? __eou__ I feel much better now . __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . __eou__ Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . __eou__ Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . __eou__ I'll take over for a while to give you a break . __eou__ Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . __eou__ Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! __eou__
I go to the fitness center every weekend . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ To lose some weight . __eou__ Why , you look pretty all right . __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job . __eou__
Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . __eou__
My mother likes to split hairs . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . __eou__ Mothers like that . __eou__
Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . __eou__ I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ? __eou__ About 7 o'clock . __eou__ Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? __eou__ No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . __eou__
It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . __eou__ is it a horror movie ? __eou__ yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? __eou__ no way . I will be scared out of my wits . __eou__ that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . __eou__ Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? __eou__ alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? __eou__ Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . __eou__ that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . __eou__ yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__ the Notebook is this type of movie . __eou__ really ? I haven't heard of it . __eou__ well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . __eou__ Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! __eou__
What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 . __eou__ It sounds too bad . What will you do ? __eou__ Mike suggests me to return it . __eou__ That ’ s what I want to say . __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ Okay , I'll follow your advice . __eou__
Hmm , what should I wear today ? __eou__ Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . __eou__ Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . __eou__
Why are you so angry , darling ? __eou__ Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . __eou__
How long will it take us to drive to London ? __eou__ I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . __eou__ That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . __eou__ You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . __eou__ So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? __eou__ Ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? __eou__ No . let me take a look ... It ’ s longer than my car . __eou__ I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__ We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . __eou__
I haven't danced for a long time . __eou__ Neither have I . __eou__ We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . __eou__ Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ? __eou__ I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ? __eou__ I've been learning Japanese every evening . __eou__ Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? __eou__ I hope to visit Japan next year . __eou__ Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . __eou__ Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . __eou__ A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! __eou__
Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? __eou__ I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . __eou__ I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? __eou__ That must be Conrad Reeves . __eou__ Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? __eou__ No , He must be her fourth or fifth . __eou__ Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__ She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__ I ’ m sure she is . __eou__ She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . __eou__ That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . __eou__
My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . __eou__ You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . __eou__ I cannot have the heart to do that . __eou__
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ No , not really . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . __eou__ You saw a ghost ? When ? __eou__ It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? __eou__ It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? __eou__ It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . __eou__
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . __eou__ A match made in heaven . __eou__
Don't be afraid . Give it a try . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__ that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . __eou__ the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__ I see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__ a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . __eou__ so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__ I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . __eou__ what do you think would make you happier ? __eou__ in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__ relationships can be confusing sometimes . __eou__ what would you do if you were me ? __eou__ I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! __eou__
What a coincidence seeing you here . ! __eou__ It is , isn't it ? __eou__
How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . __eou__ How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . __eou__ I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . __eou__ Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . __eou__ OK . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . __eou__ Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? __eou__ Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! __eou__
Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there ! __eou__ Really ? Well , thanks for saying so . __eou__ No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? __eou__ Sure . Why not ? __eou__ OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I think it's high time we had lunch . __eou__ Of course . I can eat a horse now . __eou__ I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery . __eou__ Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? __eou__ I suppose the local one . __eou__
Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__ I just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__ I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__ I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__ I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__ I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__ You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . __eou__ Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . __eou__ Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__
They are professors and government officials . __eou__ Where are they from ? __eou__ Most of them are from America and Europe . __eou__ What are they doing in Beijing ? __eou__ They are attending an international conference here . __eou__ Which hotel are they staying at ? __eou__ They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . __eou__
It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ Thanks to your help.To our friendship . __eou__ Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? __eou__ Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . __eou__ Oh , how wonderful !

Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . __eou__ Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . __eou__ People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . __eou__ Nothing seems to be happier for them . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to buy a CD . __eou__ Why not listen to music online ? __eou__ Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? __eou__ You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . __eou__ I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . __eou__ In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . __eou__ Can you recommend some to me ? __eou__ Certainly . Realplayer is a good . __eou__ Can I download it ? __eou__ Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . __eou__ I'll try it tonight . __eou__
I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . __eou__ Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__ Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__

When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . __eou__ Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__ What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__ Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__ Yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . __eou__

But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? __eou__ That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . __eou__ Is the service charged ? __eou__ No . it's free . __eou__ Really . I'll get a computer at once . __eou__

We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? __eou__ Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time . __eou__ Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! __eou__ All right , just a quick one . __eou__
I'm tired . __eou__ Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . __eou__ Yeah , I need to take a break . __eou__
Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__

Just ask her on a date . __eou__ I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone .

Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ What did it say about you then ? __eou__ For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . __eou__ But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__
Have you finished your work ? __eou__ Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby . __eou__ Where is the baby ’ s mother ? __eou__ She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . __eou__

That getup is terrific ! __eou__ Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! __eou__ That too . __eou__ I'm gonna introduce myself . __eou__ If you're lucky , that might do the trick . __eou__ Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . __eou__ Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? __eou__ My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . __eou__ I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . __eou__ OK , catch you later . __eou__
The baby is crying again . __eou__ Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . __eou__ How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . __eou__ OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . __eou__
When do children start school in your country ? __eou__ Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . __eou__

You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' __eou__ That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? __eou__ Don't be so shy , Lucy . __eou__
Do you often go to watch sports games ? __eou__ I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . __eou__ Can you recall the games ? __eou__ Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . __eou__
Rob lost his bike . __eou__ What an idiot ! __eou__

This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day !

They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I could never do that . __eou__ Very few can .

They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? __eou__ Yes , let's do it . __eou__ Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . __eou__ Of course not . We don't do that . __eou__

Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland . __eou__ And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! __eou__ The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . __eou__ That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . __eou__ No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador .

I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college . __eou__ What is this , the new Ford ? __eou__ No , it ’ s last year ’ s model . __eou__ True . How much did you pay ? __eou__ $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . __eou__ Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? __eou__ Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead .

May , is the university a terrible place ? __eou__ Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? __eou__ Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . __eou__ Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . __eou__ How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . __eou__ Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . __eou__ Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? __eou__ Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . __eou__ What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? __eou__ This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__ I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . __eou__ Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . __eou__ You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__ Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . __eou__

' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? __eou__ Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . __eou__ Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . __eou__ It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . __eou__ Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . __eou__

Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding . __eou__ I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful . __eou__ Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement . __eou__ All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . __eou__
Can you play baseball with me today ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . __eou__ Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? __eou__ No , it's not far . It's near our old house . __eou__ Can I help you pack ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? __eou__ My mother is ill in the hospital . __eou__ What does the doctor say ? __eou__ The disease fails to respond to drugs . __eou__
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . __eou__ How long is the holiday ? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time . __eou__

Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ? __eou__ Linda , that would be a perfect addition . __eou__ I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ? __eou__ I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike . __eou__ Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday ! __eou__
Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . __eou__ Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . __eou__ Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? __eou__ We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! __eou__ Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! __eou__ Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__ Is that why you missed work today ? __eou__ Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . __eou__ Www ! __eou__ I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__ Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . __eou__ Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! __eou__
Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__ In what field ? __eou__ As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . __eou__ Is he still in that that type of work . __eou__ No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . __eou__ Would you want to be a senator ? __eou__ Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . __eou__
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . __eou__ How about next week ? __eou__ Fine , we'll be expecting you then . __eou__
How about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That's great . What's on tonight ? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__ Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ On the contrary , very exciting . __eou__
Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__ It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__ You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! __eou__ Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? __eou__ If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . __eou__ Then I bet he's really good ! __eou__ Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! __eou__
The music has started . __eou__ How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice . __eou__ May I ask you for a dance ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . __eou__
You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . __eou__ If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . __eou__ I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . __eou__ I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . __eou__ Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
I like hitchhiking.will you go with me ? __eou__ Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form . __eou__ It's a pity.Say , how about a place near enough ? __eou__ To where exactly ? __eou__ New England . __eou__ That's still too far for me . __eou__
We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ That is preposterous ! __eou__ You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! __eou__ No ! The egg came first ! __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__ What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__ I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__ Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__ I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__ Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__ I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__ That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . __eou__
Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__
Hi , Nancy.How are you doing ? __eou__ Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . __eou__ Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? __eou__ You mean used car ? __eou__ No , Ah ... single sellers . __eou__ Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem . __eou__ Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . __eou__ It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . __eou__ Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . __eou__ Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? __eou__
Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? __eou__ I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Are they having a sale ? __eou__ Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . __eou__ That sounds great . Where should we meet ? __eou__ I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there . __eou__ What do you think about these shoes ? __eou__ They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? __eou__ No . Not really . __eou__ This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . __eou__ I bet it's expensive . __eou__ It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? __eou__ For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . __eou__
You look a bit dull today . What's up ? __eou__ Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__ The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__ Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? __eou__ Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . __eou__ That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . __eou__ Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . __eou__
I ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ Do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . __eou__ Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m a singer . __eou__ Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__ Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? __eou__
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? __eou__ Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . __eou__ Stereotypes ? Like what ? __eou__ Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . __eou__ I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . __eou__ Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . __eou__ You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . __eou__ I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . __eou__ Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__ Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__ I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . __eou__
Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ? __eou__ This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? __eou__ How about the Yellow Mountains ? __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
How is your ankle ? __eou__ My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . __eou__ Please be careful next time . __eou__ I will , thank you . __eou__
Is this a photo of your family ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . __eou__ You look so lovely . __eou__ How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . __eou__
Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . __eou__ Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? __eou__ Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__ Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . __eou__
Lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__ It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__ Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . __eou__ And the streets are covered with snow . __eou__ Do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . __eou__ It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__ The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__ That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__
I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? __eou__ Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . __eou__
Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? __eou__ Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? __eou__ Is today OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't go today . __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ Ok . What time ? __eou__ Is 9:00 PM all right ? __eou__ I think that's too late . __eou__ Is 6:00 PM OK ? __eou__ Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? __eou__ The Italian restaurant on 5th street . __eou__ Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . __eou__ How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? __eou__ OK , I like that place . __eou__
What's the time now ? __eou__ Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . __eou__ You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? __eou__ In the coming , before going to work . __eou__ You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . __eou__ OK . I'll turn it on . __eou__ All right . It's just four o'clock . __eou__ Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ? __eou__ Mr.Black , if I'm not mistaken . __eou__ Right ! Glad to see you here . __eou__ Pleased to see you.too . __eou__
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! __eou__ Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . __eou__
Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? __eou__ I like orange better . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because orange is much more to my taste . __eou__
Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . __eou__ What's another Japanese art ? __eou__ Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl __eou__ How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? __eou__ There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . __eou__
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? __eou__ I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__ homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? __eou__ I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . __eou__ that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? __eou__ almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . __eou__ it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . __eou__ the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . __eou__ it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__ did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? __eou__ there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . __eou__ added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__ something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__ politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . __eou__ I can only hope that one day they will change . __eou__
Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang . __eou__ Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you . __eou__ Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou . __eou__ Just call me Miao Dou , Please . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
Did you lock the doors ? __eou__ All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat . __eou__ Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . __eou__ Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight . __eou__ Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . __eou__
I ’ m sure you never dare to go against your wife . __eou__ Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas . __eou__ Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ? __eou__ Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years . __eou__ Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you . __eou__
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . __eou__
I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up . __eou__ Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie . __eou__ Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . __eou__
Have you started your report yet ? __eou__ I'm having a hard time getting the information . __eou__ It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . __eou__
Are you ready ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
Who's that tall guy over there ? __eou__ Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . __eou__ What's he like normally ? __eou__ Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . __eou__ Really ? What kind of problems ? __eou__ Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . __eou__ Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . __eou__ Really ? What makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , he doesn't look very honest . __eou__ I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? __eou__ Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? __eou__ Yes , I'll have another cocktail . __eou__ Vodka martini ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ I'll be back in a sec . __eou__ OK . I'll wait here for you . __eou__
Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow . __eou__ No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ? __eou__ Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight . __eou__ I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . __eou__ Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance . __eou__ I will miss you . __eou__ I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend . __eou__ It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . __eou__ I will . __eou__ Goodbye and have a good flight . __eou__ Thankyou . Goodbye ! __eou__
Here comes the bus . I'll ring you up later . __eou__ See you ! __eou__ See you ! __eou__
What happened ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Let's stop and have a look . __eou__ Don't waste time . __eou__ I'm curious about that . __eou__ But it's none of our business . __eou__
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ What did you argue about ? __eou__ He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__ Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ Did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__ Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? __eou__ No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . __eou__ Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? __eou__
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? __eou__ I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . __eou__ I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__ you can find out from their friends . __eou__ if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . __eou__ oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__ sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__ it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? __eou__ maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . __eou__
What does your mother do , may I ask ? __eou__ My mother works in a company as an accountant . __eou__ Is she busy ? __eou__ Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . __eou__
Are you sure you heard right ? __eou__ Yes , he is running for class president . __eou__ I don't believe you . __eou__ Take my word for it . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__
What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about going to English corner with me ? __eou__ Oh , I'd rather not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . __eou__ That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . __eou__
Jack , do say good-bye for me to the host . I've got to run . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Have you heard the news ? __eou__ I haven't heard anything . __eou__ Deborah had her baby last week . __eou__ Nobody told me . __eou__ I thought you heard . __eou__ I really wasn't told anything . __eou__ She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ Wow , how exciting . __eou__ I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . __eou__ Of course I will . __eou__ I just wanted to let you know what happened . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__
Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ? __eou__ Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do . __eou__ Me , too . What would you like to do ? __eou__ Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ? __eou__ I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? __eou__ Hmm ... I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . __eou__ We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . __eou__ I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? __eou__ I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! __eou__ Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? __eou__ I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . __eou__ Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? __eou__ That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . __eou__ Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? __eou__ I don ’ t have a car . __eou__ Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? __eou__ No . do you have a car ? __eou__ No , but I could take the bus . __eou__ Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ? __eou__ That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? __eou__ Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here . __eou__ Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ? __eou__ Huh ? We are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose ! __eou__ Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do ! __eou__ See you soon . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? __eou__ I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London . __eou__ I'm really going to miss you.Take care of yourself . __eou__ I will . __eou__
What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I listen to music and read . __eou__ What kind of music do you like ? __eou__ I think I like classical music better . __eou__ Actually me , too . __eou__
May , my grandpa is ill . I will go to look after him . Catch you later ! __eou__ OK . I will catch you later . __eou__
I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . You cannot find a better one . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ? __eou__ No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so . __eou__ Then try it yourself . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
Shakespeare was born in 1867 . __eou__ No , it sounds wrong . He was born in the 16th century . __eou__ Are you sure ? Can you make it more exact ? __eou__ 1564 . __eou__

So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? __eou__ I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff . __eou__ Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . __eou__
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ Yes . Is that so important ? __eou__ Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes , I have a three-year-old son . __eou__

You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? __eou__ Yeah.And I'm going by bus . __eou__ I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey . __eou__ But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . __eou__
Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . __eou__ I do wish I could afford one . __eou__ You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . __eou__ Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? __eou__
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__

Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__

He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . __eou__ Which team do you think will win ? __eou__ The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__

What movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? __eou__ yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? __eou__ that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? __eou__ to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ what do you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__ yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ It depends on who the film is about .

Did you know Carl is almost fifty ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . __eou__ He told me so himself . __eou__
The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? __eou__ I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . __eou__ That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__ I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . __eou__
I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . __eou__ No , I haven't had the pleasure . __eou__ Come and meet her now . __eou__ All right . __eou__

Do you have the correct time ? __eou__ I don't know what time it is . __eou__ It must be about 6 o'clock . __eou__ I have to go now . I don't want to be late . __eou__ You won't be late . It's still early . __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly __eou__
I think it's going to be a nice day . __eou__ It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . __eou__ But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . __eou__ Well , the worst of the winter should be over . __eou__
I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . __eou__ Well . All right , Mark . Just this once .

Can I come around now ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . __eou__
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! __eou__
Dear Anna . I really love you . __eou__ I love you , too . __eou__ I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? __eou__ Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? __eou__ Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... __eou__ No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . __eou__ Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . __eou__ I trust you . We'll be happy . __eou__ Let me wear you this diamond ring . __eou__ It's so beautiful . __eou__

And we have a long winter . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . __eou__
How did you know ? __eou__ It was a kind of sixth sense . __eou__ Does it happen often ? __eou__ No . __eou__
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . __eou__ Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . __eou__ And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . __eou__ Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__ There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . __eou__ That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . __eou__ Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . __eou__ My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . __eou__ OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . __eou__ Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . __eou__
I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . __eou__ I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
I ’ ll be away for a moment . __eou__ Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? __eou__ Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__ Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__ We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__ I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? __eou__ Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . __eou__ It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__ Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . __eou__
I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? __eou__ No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? __eou__ Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . __eou__
She is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ? __eou__ Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her . __eou__ What's it like to work with her ? __eou__ She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . __eou__ Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . __eou__
Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? __eou__ I wouldn't say so . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . __eou__
You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . __eou__ Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . __eou__
Is sailing fun ? __eou__ You bet ! __eou__
What do you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a firefighter . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s so cool . __eou__ I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . __eou__ What station do you work at ? __eou__ I work downtown at station 24.It can get a little crazy sometimes but that ’ s what makes it challenging . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ They use said it __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
How big is your family ? __eou__ My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I . __eou__ Who supports the family ? __eou__ My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner .

When is your birthday ? __eou__ August 1st . __eou__ Do you usually have a birthday party ? __eou__ Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . __eou__ What would you do at the party ? __eou__ We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . __eou__ Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? __eou__ Well , I don't know . __eou__ Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . __eou__ So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ? __eou__ Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . __eou__

I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . __eou__ Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? __eou__ Yes , quite sure . __eou__ I think you should put an advertisement in china daily .

I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . __eou__
I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . __eou__ Yes . I dare say it will be . __eou__ It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . __eou__ No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible .

We couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It will be summer . So it will be hot . __eou__ Is that very likely in England ? __eou__ Yes . It could happen . __eou__
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ?

What was the point of all that hard work ? __eou__ You got me . __eou__ Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . __eou__

Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__

What happened ? __eou__ Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . __eou__ Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . __eou__ What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . __eou__ But she lied to me . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town .

You have to get over her and the sooner the better . __eou__ Yeah , I know . You are right . __eou__
Hey Nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? __eou__ Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . __eou__ Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . __eou__ Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? __eou__ Let ’ s do it ! __eou__

I need a break ! __eou__ are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! __eou__ are you available on Sunday ? __eou__ yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . __eou__ ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday .

Which beach are you going to ? __eou__ it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ what should I bring with me ? __eou__ we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ I can just use my beach towel .

My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . __eou__ ok , where and when should I meet you ? __eou__ we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! __eou__

You look pale , you must have poor health . __eou__ Yeah . You said it . __eou__ Why not go to see the doctor ? __eou__ I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . __eou__

Just call me Jason . __eou__ Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? __eou__ Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! __eou__ Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . __eou__ That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . __eou__
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way . __eou__
How do you like your work ? __eou__ The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I work in a publishing house . How about you ? __eou__ Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . __eou__ What do you do then ? __eou__ I'm a clerk in a shop . __eou__
I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money . __eou__ All wet.You are such a fool . __eou__
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . __eou__ Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I guess we'll see each other around . __eou__ Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy . __eou__ You too . __eou__

The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? __eou__ I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__ oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec __eou__ wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! __eou__ tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? __eou__ perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . __eou__ no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__ we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__ great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . __eou__ no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . __eou__ Me , too .

How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean .

You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . __eou__ I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . __eou__ now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . __eou__ you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__ It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? __eou__
Just make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . __eou__ Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick . __eou__ I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__

It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ? __eou__ I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? __eou__ We ’ re identical .

Are you best friends , too ? __eou__ We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father . __eou__ I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . __eou__ What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__ No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__ Sounds like it was meant to be . __eou__

I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? __eou__ His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__ I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__ I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ Doesn't sound promising . __eou__ Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__ Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class . __eou__
Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . __eou__ And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... __eou__ Fifteen ?

But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune . __eou__ So the " Happy Birthday " song has been popular since then ? __eou__ Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . __eou__
I ’ Ve got a new boss . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s he like ? __eou__ Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And a white sports car . __eou__ Um , that ’ s good . __eou__ Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . __eou__
I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . __eou__ She means business , for sure . __eou__ Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . __eou__ We'd better get back to work . __eou__ Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... __eou__

did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? __eou__ no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . __eou__ yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . __eou__ they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . __eou__ did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? __eou__ I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . __eou__ Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__
You keep bowling spares but no strike . __eou__ I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . __eou__ I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . __eou__ Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? __eou__ The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . __eou__ Really ? I will try again . __eou__
What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? __eou__ I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . __eou__ There was a concert country music last week . __eou__ I wish I had been there ! __eou__ I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . __eou__ You have good taste in music . __eou__
Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? __eou__ You can never do that . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . __eou__
Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? __eou__ Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . __eou__ That sounds great . Is it casual ? __eou__ Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . __eou__ That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . __eou__ Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . __eou__ That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? __eou__ Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . __eou__ Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . __eou__
OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . __eou__ What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__ The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__ Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . __eou__ I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . __eou__ Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? __eou__ Hehe .. sure __eou__
Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? __eou__ Is there anything good playing ? __eou__ Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . __eou__ Really ? I want to go , too . __eou__ OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ ( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ? __eou__ I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie . __eou__ Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story . __eou__ But their love is touching ! __eou__ Ah , you're just too emotional . __eou__ I am not ! __eou__
I don't know whether or not to believe him . __eou__ You can trust him . He always tells the truth . __eou__ But it's really too important to me . __eou__ I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . __eou__
Have you seen Harry ? __eou__ No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . __eou__ Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . __eou__ Maybe you'll call his home . __eou__
I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . __eou__ Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . __eou__ But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . __eou__ Then he is really lucky . __eou__
Would you like to drink some coffee ? __eou__ No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less . __eou__ Would you like to try some watermelon juice ? It tastes good . __eou__ All right __eou__
Hello . Can I sit here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ By the way , I'm Robin . __eou__ Hi . My name is Jessica . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? __eou__ I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? __eou__ I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . __eou__ Bye . See you . __eou__
I wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . __eou__ I don't entirely agree with you . __eou__ Then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? __eou__ Well , that's a thing . __eou__
I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day . __eou__ Can you describe it , sir ? __eou__ It's a small blue case and it's got a zip . There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it . __eou__ Is this case yours ? __eou__ No , that's not mine . __eou__ What about this one ? This one's got a label . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ What's you name and address ? __eou__ David Hall , 83 , Bridge Street . __eou__ That's right . D.N.Hall . 83.Bridge Street . Three pound and fifty pence please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ This case doesn't belong to me ! You've given me the wrong case ! __eou__
Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? __eou__ Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? __eou__ It's easy , let me help you . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot . __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm doing well . How about you ? __eou__ Never better , thanks . __eou__ So how have you been lately ? __eou__ I've actually been pretty good . You ? __eou__ I'm actually in school right now . __eou__ Which school do you attend ? __eou__ I'm attending PCC right now . __eou__ Are you enjoying it there ? __eou__ It's not bad . There are a lot of people there . __eou__ Good luck with that . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see . __eou__
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . __eou__ Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? __eou__ Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . __eou__ Could you move smoothly ? __eou__ Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . __eou__ What happened afterwards ? __eou__ I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . __eou__
Bob returned from Japan last week . You know that ? __eou__ Yeah . I met him yesterday.He ' s no longer the same young man as he was eight years ago . __eou__ I think so , too . __eou__
Judy , your husband has a really nice car . __eou__ Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ We're going to visit my sister in the city . __eou__ I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? __eou__ About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . __eou__ I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? __eou__ Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . __eou__ I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . __eou__ Doesn't your mother live in the city ? __eou__ Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . __eou__ I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . __eou__ I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . __eou__ Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . __eou__
Interesting lectures , aren't they ? __eou__ Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__ Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Charies Ford . __eou__ How do you do ? I'm Bob Evans . __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like taking photos . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , look at the photos I took . __eou__ They are beautiful . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__ As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . __eou__
I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . __eou__ Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . __eou__ So you can learn a lot from him . __eou__ Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
How is he ? __eou__ Not very well . He was white about the gills . __eou__ Did he see the doctor ? __eou__ Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I don't know the reason . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . __eou__ There are no countries marked on the map . __eou__ No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . __eou__ The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . __eou__ I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . __eou__ Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . __eou__ The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . __eou__ It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . __eou__
All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . __eou__ Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . __eou__ Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . __eou__
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Oh , that sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ? __eou__ Yes , that would be perfect . __eou__ See you tonight then . __eou__ Yes . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__
what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Sorry . I've got to run . __eou__ OK . See you . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
Good afternoon , Johnson . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? __eou__ Not bad , thanks . __eou__
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__
Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ May I know your name , please ? __eou__ I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ? __eou__ I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ May I know what you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure . That would be great . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Do you have the time ? __eou__ It's ten thirty . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ Yeah , that's nice . __eou__ Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget.Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ? __eou__ The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . __eou__ I can lend you some money . __eou__ Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set . __eou__ Can I help in anyway ? __eou__ You can take me to the bank if you want to . __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . __eou__
How do you think about our boss ? __eou__ He's the nicest boss I've had . __eou__ Yes , I think he's the most relaxing person in management . __eou__ What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! __eou__ That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? __eou__ Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . __eou__ That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__ And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! __eou__ Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__ Yeah , I guess so . __eou__ You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . __eou__ Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . __eou__ You should have kept trying . __eou__
Guess what ? I've got great news ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . __eou__ Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? __eou__ She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . __eou__ Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? __eou__ It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__ Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! __eou__ Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? __eou__ I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . __eou__ I'm really looking forward to reading your column . __eou__ Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? __eou__ Sure , where would you like to go ? __eou__ Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . __eou__ You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? __eou__
Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . __eou__ Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . __eou__ How can we get there ? __eou__ We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station . __eou__ OK ! Let's go . __eou__ ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge . __eou__ Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . __eou__ Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . __eou__ Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . __eou__ We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . __eou__ It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? __eou__
Where do you spend the weekend ? __eou__ We've a country house . __eou__ That's nice . __eou__ Join us , will you ? __eou__ That'd be great ! Thank you . __eou__
Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . __eou__ Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . __eou__ Let's go to the new club on West Street . __eou__ Sure , but what do I wear ? __eou__ You can wear that pretty red dress . __eou__
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . __eou__
Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . __eou__ I didn't know you liked old movies . __eou__ I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind . __eou__ You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial ! __eou__ Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ Tomorrow will be fine too , I think . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
finally we're on board ! __eou__ yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . __eou__ are they window seats or aisle seats ? __eou__ let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . __eou__ ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . __eou__ that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . __eou__ thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? __eou__ I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__ ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . __eou__ yes ! __eou__ and no hijackers . __eou__ oh , you have too wild of an imagination . __eou__
Dad , why are you taping the windows ? __eou__ Honey , a typhoon is coming . __eou__ Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow . __eou__ Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food . __eou__ OK . Dad ! I'm coming . __eou__
It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . __eou__ He must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ He said that I put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ That means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ Well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . __eou__
What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us ? __eou__ Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ? __eou__ What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ? __eou__ Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . __eou__ Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ? __eou__ Back to live with my parents.That ' s something else I used to do before we were married.Remember ? __eou__
Hi , Mike , what gives ? __eou__ Hi , Bill , this is my new car . __eou__ Hey , great set of wheels . __eou__ You like it , huh ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . __eou__ It is special , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? __eou__ Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . __eou__ I can imagine . __eou__ Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Ok , let's go . __eou__
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__
Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . __eou__ Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Let me show you the way . Please follow me . __eou__ Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ This is it ? __eou__ It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . __eou__
Peter , how often do you exercise ? __eou__ Well , I swim and run every day . __eou__ Now , tell me , what do you eat ? __eou__ Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . __eou__ Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? __eou__ Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__ Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__
Do you want a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've given up , you know . __eou__ You don't mind if I have one . __eou__ Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ Why don't you try and give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . __eou__
Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . __eou__ Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . __eou__ I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__ The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? __eou__ I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . __eou__
Thanks a million . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Did you make it to school today ? __eou__ I always do . Did you go to school today ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? __eou__ That was an odd change of subject . __eou__ Maybe it was , but answer the question . __eou__ No , not recently . __eou__ I want to go to see a movie this weekend . __eou__ What's stopping you then ? __eou__ I don't want to go alone . __eou__ So , will you be at school tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I want to go to the movies instead . __eou__
Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . __eou__ Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . __eou__ That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! __eou__ Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! __eou__ Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . __eou__ What an amazing goal ! __eou__
How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo ! __eou__ Hey , Julie . How's it going ? __eou__ Oh , Mary . You've surprised me ! __eou__ Who were you talking to ? __eou__ Um — I was just thinking aloud . __eou__ You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes . __eou__ Come off it , Mary . __eou__ Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! __eou__ You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ? __eou__ Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him . __eou__ I guess I asked the wrong person . __eou__
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . __eou__ Thank you for your concern . __eou__
I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . __eou__ So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? __eou__ How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . __eou__
I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . __eou__ So what ? Things have changed . __eou__
Why are you so quiet ? __eou__ My girlfriend just broke up with me . __eou__ You must feel terrible now . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . __eou__ You've been through this too ? __eou__ Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . __eou__ But it hurts too much . __eou__ I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . __eou__ What if I don't want to find another girl ? __eou__ You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . __eou__ You're right . __eou__ I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? __eou__ Yeah . Thanks for the talk . __eou__ I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . __eou__ Ok . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ? __eou__ Well , flying kites is more fun to me . __eou__ I've got no kite . Do you have one ? __eou__ Let's go and buy one . __eou__
I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . __eou__ I don't know about that . __eou__
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? __eou__ Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ Who plays who ? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? __eou__ In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . __eou__ Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . __eou__ Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? __eou__ You are always so naughty . __eou__
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . __eou__ Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . __eou__ Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . __eou__
Excuse me . Have you got the time ? __eou__ My watch says half past five . __eou__ Does your watch keep good time ? __eou__ Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . __eou__ What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ I see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ They're related to one another , yes . __eou__ I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__
Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . __eou__ Oh , you're welcome . __eou__
David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? __eou__ It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal ! __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! __eou__ I don't know if anything terrible has happened . __eou__ I have reported it to the police . __eou__ We'd better prepare for the worst . __eou__
Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__ Yes . I like it very much . __eou__ Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__ It's excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__ What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? __eou__ I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__
Our team just scored a goal . __eou__ That's more like it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ They might actually win the game . __eou__
How's the weather today ? __eou__ It's hot . __eou__ I really don't think this weather will last . __eou__ Let's just hope it doesn't get hotter . __eou__
Did you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes , reading is my hobby . __eou__ What kind of books do you like to read most ? __eou__ Many kinds of books . When I was a child in elementary school , I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . When I became to a teenager at middle school , I was interested in detective mystery stories . Now I like reading romance stories . __eou__ Are you in love ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories . __eou__ Well , maybe . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ You can count on it . __eou__ I think so.Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him.He ' s good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , that scared me . __eou__ The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__ Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__ Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__ Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . __eou__
Tony looks very handsome in the suit . __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets . __eou__ Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . __eou__ As a matter of fact , he is . __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__
It's such a nice day . __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ It looks like it may rain soon . __eou__ Yes , and I hope that it does . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I really love how rain clears the air . __eou__ Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains . __eou__ Yes , but I love the night air after it rains . __eou__ Really ? Why is that ? __eou__ Because you can see the stars perfectly . __eou__ I really hope it rains today . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__
I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . __eou__ Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . __eou__
What's the name of the girl that has just passed us ? __eou__ Her name is Rose.Why ? __eou__ She's so pretty . I'd like to make friends with her . __eou__ Oh , shut up.She ' s already got married . __eou__
How do you arrange this summer vacation ? __eou__ I want to travel . __eou__ Where would you like to go ? __eou__ The seaside . __eou__ That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . __eou__ Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ That's fate . __eou__ I feel sorry for her . __eou__ Maybe this is God's will . __eou__
Bob is really handsome . __eou__ That's why he's very popular among girls . __eou__ I wish I were just as handsome . __eou__ You are ! __eou__
Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? __eou__ Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? __eou__ Things are going well for me , Joe . __eou__ Want to go see a movie tonight ? __eou__ My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . __eou__ Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? __eou__ What movie did you want to see ? __eou__ There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . __eou__ I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__ Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! __eou__
Hey , what's the matter ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . __eou__ Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__
Hey , what's good with you ? __eou__ Not a lot . What about you ? __eou__ I'm throwing a party on Friday . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Do you think you can come ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday . __eou__ What are you going to be doing ? __eou__ My family and I are going to dinner . __eou__ I was hoping you would come . __eou__ I'll definitely try to make it the next time . __eou__ I'd better see you there . __eou__ All right . I'll see you next time . __eou__
So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . __eou__ Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . __eou__ Where will it be ? __eou__ We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . __eou__ Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? __eou__ Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ You seem excited about it . __eou__ Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__ Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . __eou__ The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . __eou__ Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . __eou__
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ How about going to a concert ? __eou__ That suits me fine . __eou__
Guess what ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . __eou__ You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? __eou__ I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . __eou__ No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . __eou__ Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . __eou__ All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? __eou__ Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! __eou__ Shall we take a chance ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do so . __eou__ It's moving so slow . __eou__ What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line . __eou__ I don't think anyone will . __eou__ I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn . __eou__
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__ But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__ I'll beat him . __eou__ So beat the cat , but don't kill it . __eou__
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Oh , that sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ? __eou__ Yes , that would be perfect . __eou__ See you tonight then . __eou__ Yes . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__

I've two complimentary tickets . __eou__ With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? __eou__ It will be held at the Music Hall . __eou__ What's on the program ? __eou__ It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . __eou__

Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! __eou__ This next one is from Betty . __eou__ A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! __eou__ One more from Carla . __eou__ A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! __eou__ OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? __eou__ Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! __eou__

Hello , Janet . __eou__ Good morning , Pete . __eou__ And what is this ? __eou__ Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . __eou__
You know John ? __eou__ Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . __eou__ I wish he could too . __eou__ How ’ s your boy , Jack ? __eou__ He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . __eou__ Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? __eou__ Good luck to them . __eou__
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? __eou__ Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . __eou__ You sneak ! __eou__ I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! __eou__ But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! __eou__
I ’ m fed up with marriage . __eou__ Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . __eou__ Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet .

I thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . __eou__

Do you take a bus to and from work ? __eou__ Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . __eou__ Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . __eou__ Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__ What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__ Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__ Yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . __eou__
So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . __eou__ And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard this one before . __eou__ But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__ Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__ Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? __eou__

Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . __eou__ The service here has been really great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , the service was quite good . __eou__ So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . __eou__ I agree that 20 % would be just about right . __eou__ OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , what a nice dinner that was ! __eou__ We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . __eou__
What kinds of things do you like to do ? __eou__ I've always liked to draw and paint . __eou__ I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint . __eou__ I do it every once in a while . __eou__ How long have you known how to do that ? __eou__ I first learned how to do it in high school . __eou__ Did you take some sort of art class or something ? __eou__ That was my favorite class . __eou__ You have got to be talented . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ If only I was talented . __eou__ You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet . __eou__
So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? __eou__ Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . __eou__ And , is it what you found ? __eou__ Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . __eou__ You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . __eou__ Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? __eou__ Fine . And you ? __eou__ Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . __eou__ That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . __eou__ Good ? ! For them but not to me . __eou__ So , what's the problem ? __eou__ We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . __eou__ Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . __eou__

Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! __eou__

I thought I'd just have a look today . __eou__ would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__ sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . __eou__ ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder .

Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . __eou__ Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__

What about you ? __eou__ I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__ I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? __eou__ I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__ I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__ I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . __eou__
I am having a hard time at my job . __eou__ What's wrong , Julia ? __eou__ My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . __eou__ Don't give up so soon . __eou__ But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . __eou__ Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . __eou__ Tell that to my boss . __eou__ Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . __eou__ He was also assassinated because of his views . __eou__ He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . __eou__ Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . __eou__ That's the spirit .

How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__
That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? __eou__ Not if you pay for it .

The rain can start up again anytime . __eou__
Good game ? __eou__ Not bad . But too hot for me today . __eou__ Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? __eou__ Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? __eou__ Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . __eou__ Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? __eou__ 16 . Yours ? __eou__ No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . __eou__ Jane . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Me too . So , do you like the course ? __eou__ Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? __eou__ Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . __eou__ Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . __eou__ Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? __eou__ Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! __eou__ How awful , poor guy . __eou__ Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . __eou__ Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? __eou__ Yup . __eou__
What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . __eou__ That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! __eou__
You have a lovely house , Jack . __eou__ Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__ That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__ Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__ I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__ Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room __eou__ Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . __eou__
Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? __eou__ Fine , just fine . Thanks . __eou__ Doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . __eou__
Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ? __eou__ Total Fitness , why ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . __eou__ The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s one of those places . __eou__ Yeah , is your club different ? __eou__ Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . __eou__ Do they have a lot of equipment ? __eou__ Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna . __eou__ Sounds nice . What about classes ? __eou__ The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . __eou__ Wow , that sounds great . __eou__ Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? __eou__ Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . __eou__ Perfect . See you later . __eou__ O . K . , see you . __eou__
So Janet , do you do any sports ? __eou__ Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . __eou__ Yeah , how often do you go ? __eou__ About three times a week if I can . __eou__ Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? __eou__ Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . __eou__
Where do you live now ? __eou__ I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . __eou__ Which street do you live on ? __eou__ I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . __eou__
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of doors . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is . It does work . __eou__
This one looks great ! I love the seashore . __eou__ So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean ! __eou__ And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? __eou__ Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . __eou__ Yeah ... me , too . __eou__ Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others . __eou__ Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . __eou__ You know . I really don't those big hotels . __eou__ Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean . __eou__
John passed away . __eou__ When ? I saw him well last month . __eou__ Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late . __eou__ How terrible ! __eou__
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__ I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__ Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__ I will . See you later . __eou__
Hi Sarah , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , how are you doing ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ What do you want to do ? __eou__ I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant . __eou__ What kind of Italian food do you like ? __eou__ I like spaghetti . Do you like spaghetti ? __eou__ No , I don't , but I like pizza . __eou__
do you have internet in your room ? __eou__ sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . __eou__ really ? What do you usually do online ? __eou__ well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__ I never chatted online before . What's it like . __eou__ well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . __eou__ really ? Who do you chat with ? __eou__ to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were __eou__ that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . __eou__ well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per __eou__ don't worry . __eou__
How are you doing , Jim ? __eou__ Fine , just fine.How about you ? __eou__ Not too bad . __eou__
I'm really happy that you came to visit me . __eou__ I really missed you a lot . __eou__ I've been missing you like crazy . __eou__ I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me . __eou__ Lately , I've been quite busy . __eou__ Tell me what you've been up to . __eou__ I've really been working a lot lately . __eou__ I've been pretty busy myself . __eou__ So what have you been up to ? __eou__ I've just been working a lot . __eou__ Whatever the reason may be , I'm glad you visited me . __eou__ I'm glad I did too . __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to Croydon . __eou__ Did you go shopping ? __eou__ No , I went for an interview . __eou__ Oh , did you get a job ? __eou__ Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee . __eou__ Fantastic . __eou__
You look like a basket case . __eou__ I'm not surprised . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__ Yeah , and ? __eou__ I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__ I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__ So how long has he here for ? __eou__ Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__ Well , I know you do the right thing . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . __eou__ Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? __eou__ Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . __eou__ You are a real fan of extreme sports . __eou__ Yes . I love facing danger and overcoming it . It has become part of my life . __eou__
Good afternoon ! __eou__ Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? __eou__ I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? __eou__ Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? __eou__ Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What's the weather like in your country ? __eou__ Mm ... It's quite warm now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ In London.Where do you live ? __eou__ Here.Near this school . __eou__
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . __eou__
Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? __eou__ There ’ s a possibility . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Absolutely . Take my word for it . __eou__
What's going on ? __eou__ Not much . __eou__ This Friday , I'm throwing a party . __eou__ Oh really ? I didn't know that . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I haven't heard anything about it . __eou__ Can you make it ? __eou__ What time does it start ? __eou__ The party starts at 8 . __eou__ Yeah , I think I'll go . __eou__ Am I going to see you there ? __eou__ You will . __eou__
Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ It's my greatest pleasure to have met you.See you around . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Going to the cafeteria ? __eou__ No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? __eou__ That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . __eou__ Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . __eou__
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . __eou__
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . __eou__ And ? __eou__ And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . __eou__ Poor child ! __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . __eou__
We should keep Frank at arm's length . __eou__ Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . __eou__ He hits below the belt . __eou__ And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . __eou__
I must be going now . __eou__ Really ? Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon . __eou__ Be seeing you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Do you know Mark ? __eou__ Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . __eou__ Can you introduce him to me ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__ I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . __eou__
Do you need a ticket ? __eou__ Surely , I do . It's hard to come by , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Can you get it ? __eou__ You can be assured of it . __eou__
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ Sure . Meet me at five . __eou__
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . __eou__ I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . __eou__ YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . __eou__ On second thought , I think I'll join you . __eou__ They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . __eou__ Wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ Quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . __eou__ When in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that's nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . __eou__
Awful ! My cell phone is out of service again . Fred , can you lend me some money ? __eou__ How much do you want ? __eou__ 200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage . __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ? __eou__ It's so nice of you . You really make my day . __eou__ Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little . __eou__ What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . __eou__ No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it . __eou__
And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... __eou__ Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ No wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! __eou__ Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... __eou__ You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It says a storm may come tomorrow . __eou__ Oh ! I hate rainy days ! __eou__ Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . __eou__ What bad luck ! __eou__ Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe you are right ! __eou__
Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . __eou__ I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! __eou__ I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . __eou__ Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . __eou__ You ’ re the best ! __eou__
Hi , John ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ We went to Malaysia and Thailand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . __eou__ Wow , isn't that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . __eou__
Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? __eou__ Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! __eou__ Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! __eou__ I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? __eou__
I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . __eou__ Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . __eou__ I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . __eou__ You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don't worry . We won't be the first . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
I can ’ t wait to retire . __eou__ And then what ? __eou__ And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! __eou__ That sounds boring to me . __eou__ What do you plan on doing after you retire ? __eou__ Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . __eou__ I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . __eou__
Do you have anything to do after this ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . __eou__ I know a very interesting place . __eou__ Oh , do you ? Good . __eou__
I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . __eou__ Some other time then ? __eou__ OK.Thanks for asking me . __eou__
Excuse me , what's your name ? __eou__ My name is Jessica . What's yours ? __eou__ John . __eou__ You speak English very well . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Do you know what time it is ? __eou__ Sure . It's 5:10 PM . __eou__ What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's 5:10 PM . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Have you attended school today ? __eou__ I attended school today . Did you ? __eou__ I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ? __eou__ I would really appreciate that , thanks . __eou__ It's no trouble at all . __eou__ If you get sick , I'll return the favor . __eou__ Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better . __eou__
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? __eou__ I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__ where are you planning on going ? __eou__ I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . __eou__ would you recommend going there for a few days ? __eou__ personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__ you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? __eou__ it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? __eou__ I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . __eou__ maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . __eou__ I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__ since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . __eou__ thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine thanks . How about you ? __eou__ I'm okay . What are you doing these days ? __eou__ Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks . __eou__ That's great . When are you starting ? __eou__ Probably in a week or two . I'll let you know . __eou__

I can't stand computer geeks . __eou__ Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do . __eou__ Who do you think it is ? __eou__
Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ? __eou__ No , but I have to type my paper tonight . __eou__ Does that mean I can't use it tonight ? __eou__ You got it ! __eou__

Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ? __eou__ They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat . __eou__ Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ? __eou__ We're catching most of our fish with lures . __eou__ Lures ? We're using live bait over here . __eou__ What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? __eou__ We're using worms . __eou__ Are you having any luck with the worms ? __eou__ No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . __eou__ That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ? __eou__ I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box . __eou__ That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ? __eou__ I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ? __eou__ We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there . __eou__ Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ? __eou__ Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? __eou__ Do you think that's a good spot ? __eou__ Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . __eou__ Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now . __eou__ Good luck . I hope you each some fish . __eou__
What was that noise ? __eou__ It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking ! __eou__
I don't know . I think you might be over the hill . __eou__ Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . __eou__ Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? __eou__ Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day . __eou__
It's not good for business recently . __eou__ Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . __eou__ Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . __eou__

What's a good place for sightseeing ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__
Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ So no more regret now ? __eou__ Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . __eou__ I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . __eou__ It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! __eou__ Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . __eou__ A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . __eou__ Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! __eou__ Good that he resembled his old , quick self . __eou__
I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . __eou__ Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . __eou__ How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . __eou__ They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . __eou__ You are more beautiful than the roses . __eou__ I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . __eou__ Yes , we are match made in heaven . __eou__ I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are . __eou__ Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too .

Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . __eou__ Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . __eou__ One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ Can you tell me how it is done ? __eou__ If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . __eou__ I see . So great . __eou__
Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it . __eou__ Trust me . Everything will go well . __eou__

He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
What a police officer ! __eou__ I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films . __eou__ It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . __eou__
OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course .

Your tie is handsome . __eou__ Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . __eou__
You must like to dance , right . __eou__ I'd love to . Do you often come here to dance ? __eou__ Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful . __eou__ You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner . __eou__ Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ? __eou__ Ok , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it . __eou__ Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You're all the same . __eou__

Why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ I should finish it as soon as possible . __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step __eou__ Why can I learn it ? __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step . __eou__ I feel I really stupid . __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing planned . How about you ? __eou__ Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . __eou__ I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . __eou__ I say we get drunk tonight .

I just bought these new shoes earlier today . __eou__ Those are nice . What are they ? __eou__ These are some Chucks . __eou__ Those are great . How much were they ? __eou__ I got them for forty . __eou__ I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks . __eou__
Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? __eou__ I still have five seats in the mezzanine . __eou__ I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ? __eou__ No . Nothing . I'm sorry . __eou__
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! __eou__ No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__ Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! __eou__ Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? __eou__ Well . How do you know ? __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . __eou__ So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? __eou__ Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? __eou__ Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . __eou__ Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? __eou__ Your tent and enough food and water . __eou__ You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ? __eou__ We can go fishing , chatting and camping . __eou__ What are we waiting for ? Come on ! __eou__ Don't hurry . Wait for my call . __eou__
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__

Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . __eou__ I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . __eou__ I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! __eou__
Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . __eou__ It it true of many countries . __eou__ You know why ? __eou__ Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? __eou__ Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands .

Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . __eou__
I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . __eou__ I wouldn't do it if I were you . __eou__ It's sounds like fun . __eou__ It's very dangerous , you know . __eou__ I want to try something exciting . __eou__ It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . __eou__ I'll tell you all about it next Monday . __eou__ Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? __eou__ Well , I have the day off from work . __eou__ That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . __eou__ Sounds nice . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . __eou__ Can I stop by ? __eou__ Sure . Any time . __eou__
What ’ s the date today ? __eou__ December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . __eou__ Right . What present should we give him this time ?

You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__

How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . __eou__
Hi Kara , it's Mike here . __eou__ Hi Mike , how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing well , and you ? __eou__ Everything is going great . __eou__ Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ? __eou__ Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now . __eou__ Well , we could just go out as friends . __eou__ Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening . __eou__
Susan is going to get a divorce . __eou__ How do you know that ? __eou__ She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . __eou__ Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . __eou__
excuse me ; is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . It's all yours . __eou__ thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . __eou__ the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? __eou__ it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming . __eou__ global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . __eou__ so sure . Are you from around here ? __eou__ no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from China . What about you ? __eou__ I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . __eou__ did you enjoy it ? __eou__ I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but I saw the movie .

So far , though , it's interesting . __eou__ well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . __eou__ likewise . Bye ! __eou__
What's your favorite TV Program ? __eou__ I like variety shows . __eou__ I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . __eou__ I prefer a variety show without a host . __eou__
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . __eou__ I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . __eou__ No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . __eou__ I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . __eou__ Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 __eou__
Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? __eou__ I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . __eou__ Oh , my . What did you do ? __eou__ I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . __eou__ Did you call the police ? __eou__ Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help . __eou__
I think you're being a little naive . __eou__ If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . __eou__ That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . __eou__ eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . __eou__ $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... __eou__
What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? __eou__ I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . __eou__ Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? __eou__ You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” . __eou__ Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . __eou__
Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . __eou__ You're really sporty ! __eou__ I want to do everything I can . __eou__ Do you have clubs ? __eou__ No . Can I rent clubs ? __eou__ There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . __eou__ What kinds of clubs ? __eou__ Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . __eou__ I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . __eou__ And he's so handsome . __eou__
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
What's Beijing like ? __eou__ It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . __eou__ What can I see in Beijing ? __eou__ You can see the Forbidden City . __eou__ What ’ s it like ? __eou__ It ’ s beautiful but crowded . __eou__
Hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ Great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . __eou__ Do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ You are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica .

Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ Isn ’ t that complicated ? __eou__ No , it ’ s easy .

How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? __eou__ But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__ He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . __eou__ Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . __eou__ But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner .

I ’ Ve ruined everything ... __eou__ do you hear something ? __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea . __eou__ It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . __eou__ It may have something to do with the food I had last night __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . __eou__ I will . Thank you . __eou__

Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! __eou__ It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? __eou__

I get nervous when I talk to girls . __eou__ Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . __eou__ What do I talk about ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . __eou__ I don't know ... __eou__ Do you want me to go talk to her ? __eou__ No .

You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . __eou__ Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? __eou__ No problem . I'll tell you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it very much . __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! __eou__ Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . __eou__ I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . __eou__

Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? __eou__ Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . __eou__ Oh ... why ? __eou__ Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more .

how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? __eou__ well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__ what do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about __eou__ how do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies .

What a wonderful dinner ! __eou__ Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it . __eou__ Where did you get your fantastic recipes ? __eou__ I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me . __eou__ I especially like the wonderful chicken dish . __eou__ That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . __eou__ Is that shrimp in the soup ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . __eou__ I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal . __eou__ Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal . __eou__
They must be your parents , what do they do ? __eou__ My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . __eou__ Do they often take you out ? __eou__ No , usually they're very busy . __eou__
Are you still at that work ? __eou__ Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . __eou__ What sort of job do you have in mind ? __eou__ I think I'm quite fit for a driver . __eou__ But it's very tired . __eou__ I don't care . __eou__ What's your parents ' opinion ? __eou__ I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . __eou__
You're from New York , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ What do you suggest I should see in New York ? __eou__ Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? __eou__ No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . __eou__ Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? __eou__ Ah ! That sounds interesting . __eou__
We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . __eou__ That's great . __eou__ Now let's get things ready . __eou__ Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . __eou__ That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . __eou__
What happened to John ? __eou__ He quit __eou__
Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ? __eou__ It's so faraway . __eou__ I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 ! __eou__ $ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ... __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? __eou__ Yes , Friday I have a class right after work . __eou__ Oh . What about Saturday ?

Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . __eou__ Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? __eou__
Do you like being a doctor ? __eou__ Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . __eou__ Can you tell me about it ? __eou__ You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . __eou__ What can you do when this happens ? __eou__ Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . __eou__
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__ Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__ It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__ You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__ Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__ It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . __eou__
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea ! __eou__
Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I passed ! __eou__ Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . __eou__ Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help .

I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__ if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ that explains it . __eou__ how many more games are left this season ? __eou__ that was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ when do the playoffs start ? __eou__ in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? __eou__ of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . __eou__ Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__ sure , that would be great . __eou__ Ok , it's a date then ! __eou__

How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere . __eou__ I have decided to go to Tasha . __eou__ By train or by plane ? __eou__ By plane . __eou__
How do we spend our holiday ? Do you have any good ideas ? __eou__ Come over and chew the fat . We can enjoy to our hearts'content . __eou__
Come on . All of us are waiting for you . __eou__ Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
I'm feeling wonderful . __eou__ Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception __eou__ I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . __eou__ I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . __eou__
I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! __eou__ Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! __eou__ Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? __eou__ He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__ He sounds hot !

I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth . __eou__ Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today . __eou__ I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? __eou__ It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway . __eou__
Jenny , are you having a good time ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food . __eou__ I ’ m glad you are enjoying yourself . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .

Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ How do you research your books ? __eou__ I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . __eou__ I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__ Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__ Oh ! Thank you very much .

You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Did you take my money from the table ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . __eou__
If one is rich , is the happy ? __eou__ I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . __eou__ Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? __eou__ Of course not.Sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable . __eou__
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! __eou__
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__ But I find Japanese ones better . __eou__
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . __eou__ What is your current occupation ? __eou__ I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . __eou__ Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? __eou__ No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . __eou__ Do you like your current job ? __eou__ Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . __eou__
Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you . __eou__ Glad to see you too . __eou__
Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . __eou__ No problem . What should I bring ? __eou__ I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . __eou__
I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? __eou__ Sure . Is it your father's birthday ? __eou__ Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day . __eou__ Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ? __eou__ You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ? __eou__ Yes , let's go . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Poor , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . __eou__ You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? __eou__
How do you feel ? __eou__ I'm nervous as can be . __eou__
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . __eou__ That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
what are you watching on the telly ? __eou__ there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . __eou__ which one is that ? __eou__ the office . Have you watched it ? __eou__ I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . __eou__ it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . __eou__ what are you watching now ? __eou__ they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . __eou__ I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? __eou__ we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! __eou__ do you watch a lot of TV then ? __eou__ I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? __eou__ I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? __eou__ there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? __eou__ why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . __eou__ Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . __eou__ Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? __eou__ The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . __eou__ Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? __eou__ I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . __eou__ One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? __eou__ Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . __eou__ But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . __eou__ I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . __eou__ I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . __eou__ But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . __eou__
I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? __eou__ We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . __eou__ You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . __eou__ Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much . __eou__
Hello , ladies . I'm firing up the grill . We can eat in an hour or so . __eou__ Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ? __eou__ Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs . __eou__ Ah ... hence the buns and condiments we bought . And this is Holly's potato salad . __eou__ You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... __eou__ Let me know if I can help . __eou__
So how much should I gamble ? __eou__ Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? __eou__ Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? __eou__ I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . __eou__ I want games that are all luck . __eou__ I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines . __eou__ Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice . __eou__ So what do you want to play then ? __eou__ Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . __eou__ Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! __eou__ Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . __eou__ Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! __eou__
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__ Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__ Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
May I ask what the name is the girl ? __eou__ Which one ? __eou__ The tallest one . __eou__ She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . __eou__ Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? __eou__ OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . __eou__ How do you think about her ? __eou__ She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl . __eou__ I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . __eou__ No , she hasn't . __eou__ Great ! Thank you very much . __eou__
Let's go in . __eou__ After you . __eou__
Good morning , Kevin . __eou__ Morning , Lee . How are you ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . __eou__
Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . __eou__ What ? That's too much . __eou__ Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . __eou__
How are you wedding plans going ? __eou__ Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . __eou__ When will that be ready ? __eou__ The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . __eou__ You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . __eou__ Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . __eou__ Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . __eou__ Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . __eou__ I think you make the right decision . __eou__
I like this kind of weather . __eou__ Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . __eou__ And it's calm . I like the peace . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__
What is up ? __eou__ Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... __eou__ Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . __eou__ I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . __eou__
You say he was around average height . __eou__ Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . __eou__ Weight ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Medium I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . __eou__ Any marks on his face ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Glasses ? __eou__ No . __eou__ What about his hair ? __eou__ Black or dark brown . __eou__ Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__ Straight , I think , and about average length __eou__ Boy , this sure doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ? __eou__
What a beautiful day ! __eou__ It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . __eou__ I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today . __eou__ Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__
What are your working hours ? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . __eou__ Much better than mine . __eou__ What are your hours ? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . __eou__
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? __eou__ Yes , please . Thank you for everything . __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon.Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! __eou__ You mean with my performance ? __eou__ Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . __eou__ I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . __eou__ Where did you learn to sing like that ? __eou__ I was part of a band in school . __eou__ You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? __eou__ Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? __eou__
How are you making out these days ? __eou__ He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . __eou__
What are you grinning about ? __eou__ Stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ We ’ re going fishing . __eou__ What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ These girls are different , they are not wimpy . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . __eou__
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . __eou__ So what's the problem ? __eou__
Can we talk ? __eou__ Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ You know what I mean . __eou__ Yeah . I know . __eou__ I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... __eou__ You know , I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ Honey ... __eou__ Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ Baby , I love you so much . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ Oh , I love you too ! __eou__ Come on . Put the gun down . __eou__ Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__
What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . __eou__ In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? __eou__ Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . __eou__ Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . __eou__ Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? __eou__
My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . __eou__ Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit __eou__ We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon __eou__ OK . Let's go __eou__
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ I can speak French and German . __eou__ How well can you speak them ? __eou__ I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . __eou__ Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? __eou__ No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . __eou__
Has the chief accepted our plan ? __eou__ Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . __eou__ Let ’ s have a try . __eou__
Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? __eou__ No . How about you ? __eou__ Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . __eou__
John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? __eou__ Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? __eou__ Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . __eou__ I'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__ Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__ Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . __eou__ That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . __eou__ Okay , it sounds good . __eou__
Would you like a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__ I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__ That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . __eou__ Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . __eou__ But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? __eou__ I mean you couldn't give it up ! __eou__ Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could ! __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! __eou__
Have you met John ? __eou__ Yeah , he came back from America last week . __eou__ Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months . __eou__ He must have a good ear . __eou__
It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it __eou__ Oh . Yes . It is __eou__ Shall I light the stove ? __eou__ That ’ s a good idea __eou__ Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics __eou__
Who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ Well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6,30 suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
Is that girl your girlfriend ? __eou__ No , it's not . __eou__ She doesn't look like our classmate . __eou__ Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . __eou__ Really , she's so pretty . __eou__
What does she do ? __eou__ She works as a teller in a bank . __eou__ Does she go to night school ? __eou__ Yes . She goes three times a week . __eou__ Why ? What does she want to be ? __eou__ She wants to be a manager . __eou__ What classes does she take ? __eou__ She takes classes in accounting and business . __eou__
Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ? __eou__ I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest . __eou__ Oh right ... How about Sunday ? __eou__ Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football . __eou__ Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . __eou__ Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . __eou__ Oh great , I ’ ll see you there ! __eou__
Do you remember Tina , my good friend ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She just broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ Well , that happens . I hope she is all right . __eou__ But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . __eou__ That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . __eou__ Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . __eou__
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
Whose handset sounds so beautiful __eou__ Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? __eou__ Are you able to compose music ? __eou__ No , not yet . __eou__ Who composed it for your ? __eou__ You needn't ask anyone .

what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? __eou__ to be honest , I wouldn't . __eou__ why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__ not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__ what's the puzzle ? __eou__ my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__ oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__ yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__ oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__ but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__ definitely . __eou__ you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__ don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__ I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__ sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__
Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . __eou__ A boss likes him a lot .

Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . __eou__ I can imagine . __eou__ Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Ok , let's go . __eou__
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ How regular ? __eou__ An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__ But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . __eou__
Well , thank you.Mr.Parry , for all your information.Just one more question . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ Do you play any sports or games ? __eou__ I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer . __eou__ And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? __eou__ I was a runner_a long-distance runner . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . __eou__ Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__
Lisa , I ’ Ve been thinking of something . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well . I ’ Ve done a lot of business for my company . And now I feel like going into business for myself . __eou__ Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? __eou__ There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ? __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . __eou__
so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? __eou__ well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! __eou__ so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? __eou__ yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on __eou__ what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . __eou__ that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . __eou__ are the rooms nice and bright ? __eou__ yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . __eou__ do you have a balcony ? __eou__ no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . __eou__ you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? __eou__ it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo __eou__
I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ no-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . __eou__ I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__ I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . __eou__ Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . __eou__ I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . __eou__ Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . __eou__ How do I do that ? __eou__ Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . __eou__ That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . __eou__
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__ I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__ Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__ I will . See you later . __eou__
Have you seen the new girl in school ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__ She's really pretty . __eou__ Describe her to me . __eou__ She's not too tall . __eou__ Well , how tall is she ? __eou__ She's about 5 feet even . __eou__ What does she look like , though ? __eou__ She has pretty light brown eyes . __eou__ I may know which girl you're talking about . __eou__ So you have seen her around ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__
What channel did you watch last night ? __eou__ Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . __eou__ You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? __eou__ It was very good . I followed it right to the end . __eou__
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ Well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
He said he will get married by the end of this month . __eou__ Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . __eou__ Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
How do you like this dress ? __eou__ It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? __eou__ Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? __eou__ Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . __eou__ People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . __eou__ Any other common customs of your New Year ? __eou__ Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! __eou__ By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? __eou__ We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . __eou__ You might make a few enemies this way . __eou__ If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . __eou__ You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . __eou__ Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? __eou__ Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! __eou__ I knew you'd come around ... __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? __eou__ I'd like to very much . __eou__ All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . __eou__ Who's playing ? __eou__ It's the Powell orchestra . __eou__ Do you know what they are playing ? __eou__ They're doing a seventeenth-century program . __eou__ And who is directing ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . __eou__
Hey , what's new ? __eou__ Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? __eou__ Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . __eou__ What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? __eou__ Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . __eou__ That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . __eou__ But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . __eou__ And the second stage is called a tornado warning . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean a loud train ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . __eou__ Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . __eou__ Where is she right now ? __eou__ She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . __eou__ Hey , I'll go with you . __eou__ You don't have to . __eou__ It's really no problem . __eou__ Ok . Let's go right after dinner . __eou__
I'm going to America . __eou__ Any idea when you'll leave ? __eou__ I hope before the end of the month . __eou__ Let me know when you find out . __eou__
Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . __eou__ Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... __eou__ But what ? __eou__ But he is always talking big . __eou__
Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? __eou__ My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__ No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? __eou__ If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? __eou__ That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! __eou__ Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! __eou__
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? __eou__ Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Last night he told the children acliff-hangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep . __eou__
The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . __eou__ Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? __eou__ Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . __eou__ Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . __eou__ Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . __eou__ What are the children doing ? __eou__ They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . __eou__ I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . __eou__ Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . __eou__ Who will get the money ? __eou__ Of course the children . __eou__
There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__
Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An . __eou__ Hi , An . How are you ? __eou__ I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? __eou__ I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . __eou__ Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . __eou__ Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . __eou__
Great party , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . __eou__ This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . __eou__ Oh , so you're a teacher . __eou__ Yeah , history , what about you ? __eou__ I'm in the car business . __eou__ Salesman ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Oh , I see , by the way , my name's Mary . __eou__ Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor . __eou__

It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight .

Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I can handle that .

I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying .

My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . __eou__ What's there after that ? __eou__ Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ What are they all for ? __eou__ Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . __eou__ That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__ Ok , good luck to you . __eou__
How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? __eou__ Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . __eou__ Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? __eou__ Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . __eou__ Why would you say that ? __eou__ They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . __eou__ I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . __eou__ Have you ever been to Japan ? __eou__ Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . __eou__
Let me take care of the check today . __eou__ Why ? It's unfair . How about going dutch ? __eou__ You paid the last time , because I didn't have any money , remember ? __eou__ Oh , come on , I almost forgot . Don't worry about it . I didn't mind picking up the tab last time . __eou__ But you really should let me treat one time , I feel like I own you one if I didn't . __eou__ Ok , but it's only for this time . __eou__ What's the damage ? __eou__ It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together . But don't forget the tip , it usually 15 % . __eou__ Check , please . __eou__
How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . __eou__ You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . __eou__ Today ? __eou__ Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . __eou__ Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . __eou__ If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . __eou__ I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . __eou__
He has a girlfriend already . __eou__ You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . __eou__ Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . __eou__ I hope I will meet her soon . __eou__
Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ? __eou__ A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest . __eou__ That it easy.They get caught before they come here . __eou__ Stop your nonsense ! Quick . Let ’ s leave the place ! __eou__
Do you love me ? __eou__ I ’ m very fond of you . __eou__ Yes , but do you love me ? __eou__ Why ? You mean a lot to me . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? __eou__ What question ? __eou__ Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear . __eou__ You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I---I don ’ t feel like saying it __eou__
Would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . __eou__ Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? __eou__ I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening . __eou__ She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check . __eou__ Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together . __eou__ Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? __eou__ I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . __eou__ I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . __eou__ I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . __eou__ I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave . __eou__
My brother joined the army last year . __eou__ Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? __eou__ He's tall and strong . __eou__ I can tell it from your build . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a doctor . __eou__ Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__ I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__ Oh , do you enjoy it ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . __eou__
Can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ What are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . __eou__ Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ He got arrested all right . __eou__ If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__ That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__
Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to attend an interview . __eou__ What kind of job are you applying for ? __eou__ My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . __eou__ Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . __eou__ Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . __eou__ Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . __eou__ Then what should I do ? __eou__ Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . __eou__
I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? __eou__ Yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__ That's a crying shame . It really is ! __eou__ Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . __eou__
Anything interesting in this city ? __eou__ We have a beautiful natural park . __eou__ It's worth the time . __eou__ Come on.Let ' s walk there . __eou__
Mary , it's good to see you ! __eou__ Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by . __eou__ I am so glad that you decided to stop by ! __eou__ Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . __eou__ Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ? __eou__ Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty . __eou__ How about a little snack then ? __eou__ No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago . __eou__ Well then , how is your family ? __eou__ Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby . __eou__
You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? __eou__ I'm sorry , It's all my fault . __eou__ You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . __eou__ Sorry , I had no intention . __eou__ It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? __eou__ I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . __eou__
Did you tip the bellboy ? __eou__ Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . __eou__ That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . __eou__ It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! __eou__ I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . __eou__ I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? __eou__ Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . __eou__
How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? __eou__ In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . __eou__ But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? __eou__ You are deadly right . __eou__
I want to say goodbye to everyone . __eou__ You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? __eou__ I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning . __eou__ how about I come and see you off ? __eou__ You really don ’ t need to . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__ Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . __eou__ Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . __eou__ Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . __eou__
The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Don't I know you ? __eou__ I'm not sure.You look familiar . __eou__ You're Mr.Stevenson , right ? __eou__ Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember . __eou__
Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? __eou__ Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! __eou__ Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! __eou__ I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? __eou__
Do you believe in god ? __eou__ Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? __eou__ I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__ I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . __eou__
Did you listen to the weather forecast ? __eou__ No . Why ? __eou__ There's a typhoon coming . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? __eou__ Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__ Why ? What was it about ? __eou__ It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , __eou__ I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . __eou__
I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . __eou__ It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . __eou__
Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . __eou__ I'd be glad to tell you what I think . __eou__ Good ! I'm interested in your advice . __eou__ If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . __eou__ Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? __eou__ I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . __eou__ You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? __eou__ Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . __eou__ I agree . I appreciate your helping me . __eou__
Here , Let me get the door for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ Actually , i could you some help.Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__
Hello , Jill . __eou__ Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? __eou__ Fine , only a little tired . __eou__ You'll recover after a good night's sleep . __eou__ Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . __eou__ That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . __eou__ It's my pleasure . __eou__ I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them . __eou__ Thank you.Thank you for the trouble you've taken . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
I heard you've found a new job . __eou__ Yes , I'm now working in a company . __eou__ So you're quite happy with your new job ? __eou__ Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . __eou__
When do you want to have the open house party ? __eou__ How about next Friday ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . __eou__ How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? __eou__ I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . __eou__ That's what I was thinking . __eou__ I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . __eou__ Do you feel like a king in your castle ? __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__
Hello , is Jack there ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . __eou__ Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . __eou__ Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? __eou__ Is six o ’ clock okay ? __eou__
Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? __eou__ I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... __eou__ Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive ? __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will . __eou__
Hi , I am looking for a woman named Mia . __eou__ I think I am who you are looking for . You have got to be Rubin . __eou__ That would be me ! __eou__ Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . __eou__ I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! __eou__ They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . __eou__ Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . __eou__ Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! __eou__ I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe . __eou__ Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out ! __eou__
Do you want to try the new coffee here ? __eou__ Great . I ’ ll have a shot . __eou__
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . __eou__ I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million . __eou__ What if I said no ? __eou__ Ever hear of WebTracker ? __eou__ You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . __eou__ I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . __eou__ OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . __eou__
Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . __eou__ I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__
If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ Why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ Oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
I'll come see you tomorrow . __eou__ Promise ? __eou__
Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? __eou__ Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday . __eou__ Oh wow . How was it ? __eou__ Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? __eou__ Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . __eou__ Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . __eou__ What a great idea . __eou__
Would you honor us with a visit ? __eou__ I'd love to . Thanks . __eou__ When will you be convenient ? __eou__ Any time will suit me . __eou__ Are you doing anything tomorrow ? __eou__ I'm free tomorrow . __eou__ I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? __eou__ All right , see you then . __eou__
I couldn't wait to meet you in person . __eou__ Me , too . I've heard so much about you . __eou__ Same here . __eou__ I was looking forward to your arrival . __eou__
Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so . __eou__ How about going to a concert ? __eou__ That ’ s should be fun . __eou__
My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . __eou__ What's changed ? __eou__ My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . __eou__ I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . __eou__ My wife will be going back to work soon . __eou__ You should have more money then . __eou__ Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . __eou__
Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . __eou__ Do you have a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , my wife is coming to get me . __eou__ That's good . Do you live near here ? __eou__ No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? __eou__ I live downtown , with my parents . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ I don't need a car . I walk to work . __eou__ You're lucky ! __eou__
You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . __eou__ No , thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ What about some drink ? __eou__ Please bring me a cup of coffee . __eou__
What are you going to do next year ? __eou__ I want to go traveling . __eou__ Do you have any where in mind ? __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . __eou__
Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . __eou__ Fine , I'll take a taxi . __eou__ Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . __eou__ Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . __eou__ Ha-ha , see you then . __eou__
Do you like travelling ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Do you usually travel by bus ? __eou__ No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . __eou__
Who's that man over there talking to James ? __eou__ Where ? Oh , that's Henry . __eou__ He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? __eou__ He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . __eou__ Really ? I love eccentric people . __eou__ Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . __eou__ Why ? What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Well , haven't you heard ? __eou__ Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . __eou__ Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . __eou__ Really ! How fascinating . __eou__ According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . __eou__ Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . __eou__ Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . __eou__
Are you travelling in America ? __eou__ No , I am on business .

I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__

Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ What about the party ? __eou__ It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance .

Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . __eou__

My family is pretty laid back . __eou__ How Ay people will be there at dinner ? __eou__ Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . __eou__ That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . __eou__
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__
I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . __eou__ Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . __eou__ You've formed a sound habit . __eou__ I think so , too . __eou__

Are you doing the football pools , Brian ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . __eou__ You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ? __eou__ If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat . __eou__ I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . __eou__ All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful __eou__ But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ? __eou__ If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if ! __eou__
Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . __eou__ What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? __eou__ Sounds good .

I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Dad , what's the date ? __eou__ It's December eighteenth . __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I know that . __eou__ So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? __eou__ Sure , a promise is a promise . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . __eou__ Don't mention it , let's go in . __eou__ Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? __eou__ She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? __eou__ A little , I wish I could do that . __eou__ You can ! With a little practice . __eou__ Look at him , he's buff . __eou__ I think he's hot too . __eou__ How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? __eou__ Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . __eou__ That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . __eou__ Good for you , Leslie ! __eou__

I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t __eou__ how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ how would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b __eou__ how many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . __eou__

I'm just asking . __eou__ I really don't think it's any of your business . __eou__ That's not nice . __eou__ I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now . __eou__ Okay . __eou__

What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again .

Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives .

Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . __eou__ Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . __eou__ I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . __eou__

That would be racist . __eou__ But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__ Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__

Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? __eou__ It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__

I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ you don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ so what did you do ? __eou__ we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__ my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? __eou__ of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . __eou__ that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__
What's this , I wonder ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . __eou__ A coffee grinder ? __eou__ Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . __eou__ Oh , that would be very useful . __eou__
What do you want to do tomorrow night ? __eou__ What--is tomorrow night something special ? __eou__ It's Friday . We should go party . __eou__ I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . __eou__ Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . __eou__ Do you feel like dancing ? __eou__ Yes ? Why not ? __eou__ Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . __eou__ They aren't alcoholic ! __eou__ No , maybe they're not . But they're close . __eou__ So where should we go ? __eou__ Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . __eou__ You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . __eou__ The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? __eou__ It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . __eou__ No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . __eou__ It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? __eou__ Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . __eou__ No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! __eou__ It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? __eou__ Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . __eou__ Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
How long have you been in this company ? __eou__ I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__ You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__ It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . __eou__
People are funny . __eou__ They sure are . __eou__ Did you hear about the pilot ? __eou__ The one that stole a small plane ? __eou__ Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . __eou__ Did they catch him ? __eou__ Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . __eou__ Did he crash ? __eou__ No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant . __eou__ Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ? __eou__ His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . __eou__ Poor guy . __eou__
Hello , is this People's Theater ? __eou__ Yes , it is . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ? __eou__ What date , sir ? __eou__ October 16th . __eou__ Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ? __eou__ 7:30 p . m . performance , please . __eou__ OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan . __eou__ I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please . __eou__ All right .

After you . __eou__ No , after you . Ladies first . __eou__ That's very kind of you . __eou__
have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? __eou__ no , what's it about ? __eou__ apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__ she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__ I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__ I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__ you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . __eou__ did they mention that in the article ? __eou__ yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__ that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__ I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__ it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__ what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . __eou__
Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? __eou__ Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . __eou__ I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . __eou__ I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? __eou__ I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . __eou__ Do we have Christmas pudding ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . __eou__ I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! __eou__ I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! __eou__
Is that true ? __eou__ I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . __eou__ Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! __eou__ That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . __eou__ She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . __eou__ Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . __eou__
Hi , Francis . __eou__ Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . __eou__ Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . __eou__ Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . __eou__ Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__ Me too . Have a great day . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to live in . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
Which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ Isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
Are you busy next Saturday ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ? __eou__ Sure I like shopping . Who is organizing the party ? __eou__ One of the girls in my office . __eou__ What's the occasion ? __eou__ There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . __eou__ That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . __eou__ Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? __eou__ Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . __eou__ Oh good . __eou__ Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ Is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__
What's your favorite hobby ? __eou__ I'd like reading books best . __eou__ What kinds of books do you like to read ? __eou__ Literature and economy . __eou__ By the way , would you like to see movies ? __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . __eou__ I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . __eou__ That's a bad habit . __eou__
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__
What's your favorite book ? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind . __eou__ Why do you like it best ? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ Well . I like the Thom Birds best . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I like the writer's language , too . __eou__ If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! __eou__
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ?

How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! __eou__ Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . __eou__
I'm feeling hungry . __eou__ Isn't it time for dinner ? __eou__ Yes , let's get something to eat . __eou__ How about Mac Donald's ? __eou__
Tom did me many favors . __eou__ For example ? __eou__
My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! __eou__ Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? __eou__ Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection . __eou__ Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... __eou__ You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! __eou__ Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? __eou__ Near sighted . __eou__
Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . __eou__ You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . __eou__ I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? __eou__ Just take it easy . Come on with me . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ? __eou__
Here is the song list . __eou__ Do you have any English songs ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on . Oh , and I ’ d like to try Everything I do I do it for you . __eou__ Let me play it for you . __eou__ Is it easy to locate it ? __eou__ It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . __eou__ I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn . __eou__ I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging , first in Chinese then in English . __eou__ That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . __eou__
Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? __eou__ I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . __eou__ I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . __eou__
You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . __eou__ I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . __eou__
Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . __eou__ No problem . What should I bring ? __eou__ I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . __eou__ They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . __eou__ That ’ s human nature . __eou__
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? __eou__ Well , I have the day off from work . __eou__ That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . __eou__ Sounds nice . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . __eou__ Can I stop by ? __eou__ Sure . Any time . __eou__
There is something wrong with my girlfriend . __eou__ What's the trouble ? __eou__ The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . __eou__ What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? __eou__ Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? __eou__
My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__ Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , I appreciate that ! __eou__
Can you tell Bob from Tom ? __eou__ How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . __eou__ Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . __eou__ You really have keen eyes . __eou__
Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ It seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . __eou__ I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . __eou__
You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ Can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . __eou__
I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . __eou__ Yeah , I come here every now and then . __eou__
I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . __eou__ Is it horror movie ? __eou__ Yeah , I love horror movies the most .

Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . __eou__ In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies . __eou__ Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much . __eou__ The Terminal is a movie of this type . __eou__ So we can relax now . __eou__ Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . __eou__
Say , what's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . __eou__ Do you play much tennis ? __eou__ Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ? __eou__ Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all . __eou__
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
So Kevin , what is your type ? __eou__ I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . __eou__ I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh . __eou__ That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . __eou__
Hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . __eou__ Is it a horror movie ? __eou__ Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? __eou__ No way . I will be scared out of my wits . __eou__ That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . __eou__ Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ? __eou__ Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? __eou__ Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . __eou__ That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . __eou__ Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__ The Notebook is this type of movie . __eou__ Really ? I haven't heard of it . __eou__ Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . __eou__ Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! __eou__
Look out ! Your tea water is running over . __eou__ Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ? __eou__ To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . __eou__ Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? __eou__ By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . __eou__ I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . __eou__ Why ? Did you feel frightened ? __eou__ For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . __eou__ What did the pilot do ? __eou__ He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . __eou__ Did you land safely ? __eou__ Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . __eou__
I'm tired of this job . __eou__ So am I . __eou__
Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? __eou__ John , I am just not in the mood for this . __eou__ You look so upset . What's going on ? __eou__ I lost the table tennis game yesterday . __eou__ Oh , what a pity ! __eou__ I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . __eou__ Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . __eou__ My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . __eou__ Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . __eou__ Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure . __eou__ I understand . __eou__
Sorry , I need a trip to the bog . __eou__ Please yourself . __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great ! __eou__
What's going on ? __eou__ Nothing really , you ? __eou__ I'm throwing a party next Saturday . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , are you going to come ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I don't really want to . __eou__ Well , why don't you ? __eou__ I hate going to parties . __eou__ Well , that's okay . __eou__ Yeah , sorry . __eou__
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! __eou__
Hi ! Peter . How are you ? __eou__ Fine ! How about you ? __eou__ Pretty good . __eou__
I'm going shopping . __eou__ Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? __eou__ No . I need to borrow $ 50 . __eou__ Sure , here you go . __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__
Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . __eou__ Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . __eou__ But what are the sources of water pollution ? __eou__ They could generally be divided into two categories __eou__ Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . __eou__ But what about the indirect ones ? __eou__ Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . __eou__ I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . __eou__ Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . __eou__
Wanna chill out and watch cable ? __eou__ Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? __eou__ It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . __eou__ This show is like a black Friends . __eou__ BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV . __eou__ That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . __eou__
The world changes , the family changes too . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . __eou__ That is called a nuclear family . __eou__ I don't like such a family . __eou__ What kind of family are you like ? __eou__ I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . __eou__ It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . __eou__ We can live well , I think . __eou__
I need to go to the bank . __eou__ But they are closed today . __eou__ Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ? __eou__ Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ? __eou__ Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day __eou__ You forgot all about it , didn't you ? __eou__ So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . __eou__ Better not forget that , so kill you if you don't get her something . __eou__
Hello , this is Shogun Restaurant . __eou__ Hello , I need to make a dinner reservation . __eou__ Can you tell me what night you will be coming ? __eou__ We will be coming to your restaurant on Tuesday night . __eou__ What time will you be dining with us ? __eou__ Our first choice would be 7 __eou__ How many guests will be in your party ? __eou__ Four of us will be coming . __eou__ Please just give me your name , and at 7 __eou__ Great ! Our last name is Foster . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Foster , see you this Tuesday at 7 __eou__ I look forward to having dinner at your restaurant . Thank you for your help . __eou__
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__
Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? __eou__ Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . __eou__ Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . __eou__ Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . __eou__ So there are only five working days in a week ? __eou__ Right . What are you going to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm going to study . __eou__ On a Friday night ? __eou__ Well , I need to polish up my English . __eou__
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . __eou__ let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . __eou__ I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . __eou__ you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__ I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . __eou__ we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? __eou__ that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . __eou__ the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . __eou__
Excuse me . May I come in ? __eou__ Sure . Come on in . __eou__
What time is our connecting flight ? __eou__ Let me check.Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 . __eou__ Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? __eou__ It ’ s at ... gate 14 . __eou__ Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal ! __eou__ OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! __eou__ I ’ m be right behind ya ! __eou__
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? __eou__ In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . __eou__
How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? __eou__ Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . __eou__ I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . __eou__ It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . __eou__ Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it . __eou__ If you have any question , you can ask me . __eou__ OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving . __eou__ All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Did you watch the live telecast of the World Cup last night ? __eou__ I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert . __eou__ What's the band called ? __eou__ Love Music Woman __eou__
The government has to face a lot of social problems now . __eou__ I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . __eou__ But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . __eou__ You are right . __eou__
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . __eou__ in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__ not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo __eou__ some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . __eou__ well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? __eou__
I've heard that Tom is going to move . __eou__ What ? Are you sure about that ? __eou__ Yeah , he is going to move next month . __eou__ Where is he going ? __eou__ He is going to Canada and to live with his son . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . __eou__ I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . __eou__ Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__
What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy . __eou__ His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . __eou__ How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys . __eou__ Love is blind , you know . __eou__
What did you say when she told you the news ? __eou__ I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . __eou__ But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . __eou__ How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill ? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . __eou__
London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . __eou__ Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . __eou__ She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! __eou__
Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . __eou__ I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? __eou__ You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__ We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__ I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__ Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! __eou__ I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! __eou__
Excuse me . Do you have the time ? __eou__ My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . __eou__ Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? __eou__ If we start now , we can make it by taxi . __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__
Good morning , Jim ! __eou__ Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze . __eou__ It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ? __eou__ We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ? __eou__ What did the whetherman say ? __eou__ He ’ s predicting clear skies . __eou__ Well , I will think it over . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
I'd like to say good-bye to everyone . __eou__ What time are you going ? __eou__ My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . __eou__ Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! __eou__ Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . __eou__
I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . __eou__
Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ? __eou__ I've heard about it , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . __eou__ Really ? I got mine from her this morning . __eou__ I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow . __eou__ You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ? __eou__ I want to . I heard it's going to be really fun . __eou__ I know , it does sound pretty awesome . __eou__ Well , when does the party start ? __eou__ It's supposed to start at about eight . __eou__ How many invitations has she given out ? __eou__ I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet . __eou__ I really want to go , so I hope that she gives me my invite soon . __eou__
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . __eou__ Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . __eou__ I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . __eou__ OK.See you on Today . __eou__ See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . __eou__ You too.Thanks for dropping in . __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? __eou__ I'd like to very much . __eou__ All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . __eou__ Who's playing ? __eou__ It's the Powell orchestra . __eou__ Do you know what they are playing ? __eou__ They're doing a seventeenth-century program . __eou__ And who is directing ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . __eou__
Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . __eou__ I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . __eou__ What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . __eou__ Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . __eou__ Really ? What ’ s the catch ? __eou__ There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan . __eou__ So what does this plan include ? __eou__ Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option . __eou__ Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? __eou__ That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... __eou__
Is there any more vodka in that bottle ? __eou__ Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes . __eou__ Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . __eou__ Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene . __eou__ So Irene , what do you do ? __eou__ I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard . __eou__ Macrohard , eh ? __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I have my own company that designs computer systems . __eou__
I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . __eou__ I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . __eou__ I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . __eou__ But I think time can change everything . __eou__
How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing great . __eou__ What movies have you seen lately ? __eou__ I saw Forrest Gump the other day . __eou__ What type of movie is that ? __eou__ The movie type is drama . __eou__ I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . __eou__ I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . __eou__ What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? __eou__ I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . __eou__ Out of those what is your favorite ? __eou__ My favorite is to play computer games . __eou__ What is your favorite computer game ? __eou__ My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . __eou__ If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? __eou__ Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . __eou__ That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? __eou__ I am going to go to the bookstore . __eou__ I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Great . I'll see you on Saturday . __eou__ Ok . See you later . __eou__
Look how fast that car can accelerate ! __eou__ I've never seen anything like it . __eou__
Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Did you use to work at NYU ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student . __eou__ Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ? __eou__ Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university . __eou__ I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ? __eou__ Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now . __eou__ A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ? __eou__ Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . __eou__ Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . __eou__
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . __eou__ No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . __eou__
He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . __eou__ You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . __eou__ Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . __eou__
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? __eou__ That would be fine . Where are you going ? __eou__ We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . __eou__ Great . __eou__ And don't forget your fishing tackle . __eou__ Ok . I like fishing very much . __eou__
You're from New York , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ What do you suggest I should see in New York ? __eou__ Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? __eou__ No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . __eou__ Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? __eou__ Ah ! That sounds interesting . __eou__
Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Harry ? __eou__ We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . __eou__ Will you travel by sea or by air ? __eou__ We may travel by sea . __eou__ It ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . __eou__ I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . __eou__ Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t __eou__
Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! __eou__ Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . __eou__ It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me . __eou__ Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them . __eou__ Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once ! __eou__ Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way . __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock . __eou__ Take care , and give my best to your parents . __eou__ Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each .

We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? __eou__ I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ What a good idea ! __eou__

I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! __eou__

That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet .

So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? __eou__ I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ Do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to meet the cast !

Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time __eou__ Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? __eou__ Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . __eou__ Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? __eou__
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . __eou__ Oh , my god , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__ Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ The pain is killing me . __eou__ I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . __eou__ I thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? __eou__ God ! It's freezing ! __eou__ Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . __eou__
Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . __eou__ Come on , just a little piece . __eou__ Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__ That's amazing . __eou__ If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . __eou__ Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__ I just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . __eou__
Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__ I am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__ Why ? I think the meeting went well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . But what are you worried about ? __eou__ I'm afraid I was too rude . __eou__ Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . __eou__ I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ You mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ Yes . And he is the president of the company . __eou__ Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__ I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . __eou__ Good . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . __eou__
Have you seen this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ They killed another hostage . __eou__ Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__ I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__ Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? __eou__ I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . __eou__ Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? __eou__ Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . __eou__ Great . What do you think of it ? __eou__ The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? __eou__ Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . __eou__ What is the special local product ? __eou__ The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ I hope to go there someday . __eou__
Hi , Bob , this is Mary . __eou__ Hello , Mary , where do you work ? __eou__ I work for an Internet company . __eou__ Is the pay good ? __eou__
Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . __eou__ Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . __eou__ How did he make a fortune ? __eou__ He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . __eou__
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . __eou__ Please don't tell me you bought it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ If you did , you probably got ripped off . __eou__
Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus . __eou__ Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient . __eou__ Okay . It will be a new experience for me . __eou__ We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy . __eou__ where do we pay the fare ? __eou__ Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . __eou__ Let me pay for it . __eou__ Where can I get the subway Madam ? __eou__ Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . __eou__ Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ? __eou__ No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . __eou__
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . __eou__
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . __eou__ Are you sure of that ? __eou__ I am not certain about that . __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ The performance is excellent . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Do you have concert halls in your city ? __eou__ Yes , but it's much smaller . __eou__ Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ? __eou__ Yes , certainly.How can I help you ? __eou__ Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ? __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. __eou__ Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ? __eou__ Certainly not.Here it is . __eou__ Thanks a lot __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you doing anything special ? __eou__ We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ How many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . __eou__ Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . __eou__ You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . __eou__ Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? __eou__ Manchester United . What about you ? __eou__ Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? __eou__ I have confidence in them . __eou__
Hello ? Is that Mark ? __eou__ How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . __eou__ I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? __eou__ Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? __eou__ Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . __eou__ Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . __eou__ That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . __eou__ Same here . __eou__
Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! __eou__ Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! __eou__ Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh ... I don ’ t know . __eou__ I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies . __eou__ Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere . __eou__ Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting . __eou__ Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? __eou__ Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet here . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? __eou__ James Cameron , of course . __eou__ Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? __eou__ Well , nobody's perfect ! __eou__
Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . __eou__ Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . __eou__ It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__
I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__ Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__ No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ Thanks ! We love it . __eou__ Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . __eou__ I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__
What do you do now ? __eou__ I'm out of work at the moment . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I was fired last week . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ What's your plan now ? __eou__ After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . __eou__ Best wishes for you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . __eou__ Why don't you make up with John . __eou__ It's too late . __eou__
Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . __eou__ I know that . __eou__ You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . __eou__ Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... __eou__ & you ? __eou__ Look , I am playing the piano for you . __eou__ Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . __eou__ Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . __eou__ OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . __eou__ Ha ! She is too little . __eou__ Cute , like you . __eou__ I want to tell you that I like you __eou__ Me too . Send you a kiss ... __eou__ Thx . __eou__
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . __eou__ Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . __eou__
Personnel . May I help you ? __eou__ Hi , could I speak to Nancy please ? __eou__ This is she . Paul ? __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s me . Can you give me a lift after work ? __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . __eou__ I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . __eou__ Well , drop by if you can . __eou__ I will , do you want me to bring anything ? __eou__ No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . __eou__
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform can not be carried out well . __eou__ The government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__
That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? __eou__ Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? __eou__
Write down your name here in ink . __eou__ But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . __eou__
Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now . __eou__ Could you stay a little longer ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . I really have to go . __eou__ In that case , I won ’ t keep you.Remember to give me a call . __eou__ Thank you for your delicious meal . __eou__
Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . __eou__ Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? __eou__ Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__ Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . __eou__
What did her boss say to you ? __eou__ He asked me to beef up in the work . __eou__ Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . __eou__ Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . __eou__
Mr . Clinton , it's nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? __eou__ Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? __eou__ Not bad . But she's as busy as before . __eou__
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . __eou__ I don't mind at all . __eou__ All right.Are you married ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . __eou__ Then , when do you plan to get married ? __eou__ I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air . __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Search me . __eou__
Did you pass the test ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__ Right . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . __eou__ Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come . __eou__
Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . __eou__ Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold . __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all . __eou__ Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
Do you have any year-end benefits ? __eou__ I don ’ t know till now . __eou__ I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . __eou__ Why they hold a flour war ? __eou__ They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . __eou__ They are not feeling satisfied ? __eou__ It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . __eou__ But how guilty to waste food ! __eou__
Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full . __eou__
I plan to buy a car this year . __eou__ How do you pay for it ? __eou__ I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . __eou__ Tell me if you need help . __eou__
This is a precious opportunity for us and our company . __eou__ You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . __eou__
Hello , Pam . __eou__ I'm glad that you can make it . __eou__ It looks like there are a lot of people inside . __eou__ Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . __eou__ Should I take my shoes off ? __eou__ We all keep our shoes on indoors . __eou__ Where are your parents ? __eou__ They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__
It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . __eou__ I did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__ If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . __eou__ But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . __eou__
Hey Bobby . What's going on ? __eou__ Just taking a smoke break . __eou__ I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I didn't know you smoked . __eou__ Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . __eou__ Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . __eou__ You ever tried to quit ? __eou__ Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . __eou__ Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . __eou__ I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . __eou__ I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ No problem . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . __eou__ Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . __eou__ Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? __eou__ Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . __eou__ All right . I only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thanks a lot , bye bye . __eou__ You are welcome , bye . __eou__
Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go ! __eou__ I want to see you play . Be quick ! __eou__ Don ’ t chicken out ! Come on ! __eou__
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? __eou__ I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? __eou__ It's white gold . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . __eou__ That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? __eou__ That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . __eou__ You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . __eou__ Why not a ring ? __eou__ I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . __eou__ But you're ready for everything else ? __eou__ Akha . __eou__
Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on . __eou__ I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . __eou__ Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? __eou__ Well how about meeting at my place ? __eou__ That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . __eou__
Excuse me . Have you got the time ? __eou__ My watch says half past five . __eou__ Does your watch keep good time ? __eou__ Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__ Please think it over . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . __eou__ It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . __eou__ Ur , you really let me down . __eou__ Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . __eou__ No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . __eou__ What day is it on earth ? __eou__ It ’ s the anniversary of our weeding . __eou__
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . __eou__ But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? __eou__ It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__ That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__ Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__ But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . __eou__ How about the new bar across road ? __eou__ Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . __eou__ I agree , I had lunch there last week . __eou__ Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__
What lovely weather ! __eou__ It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . __eou__ Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__ All right.Let ' s go . __eou__
What type of movies do you like ? __eou__ I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . __eou__ That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? __eou__ Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . __eou__ Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . __eou__ Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . __eou__ Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . __eou__
Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! __eou__ Em , it's delicious ! __eou__ Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ Autumn . Autumn is the best season in Beijing . __eou__ I like autumn , too . Where I'm from , Autumn is the best time of year . __eou__
Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ Which is easier to learn ? __eou__ Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . __eou__
I can't even imagine you snorkeling ! __eou__ Well , you'll see . With this new watch , I can go anywhere , do anything . __eou__ OK , Bond . __eou__ No , really . Look . It's got a double time zone setting . __eou__ So you can always keep two times at once ? __eou__ Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ... __eou__ The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late . __eou__
So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? __eou__ Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . __eou__ Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? __eou__ Now that's a great plan . It's a date ! __eou__
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later . __eou__
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither . The game ended in two all . __eou__ But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . __eou__ But the Brazilian is tougher . __eou__
Have you got your invitation yet ? __eou__ My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? __eou__ The house warming party . __eou__ Whose house warming party is it ? __eou__ Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . __eou__ Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . __eou__ It's out in the suburbs . __eou__ Have you seen the house ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . __eou__ Is it nice ? __eou__ Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . __eou__ There's also a garden . __eou__ Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? __eou__ They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . __eou__ When are they going to have the party ? __eou__ Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . __eou__ Wow , that would be something to look forward to . __eou__
When ’ re you getting married ? __eou__ We planned our wedding for next May . __eou__ Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? __eou__ Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . __eou__ That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? __eou__ Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . __eou__ Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . __eou__
Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics ! __eou__ Steve , I was born ready ! I ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today . __eou__ We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running . __eou__ Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up . __eou__ You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . __eou__
Have you met Professor Smith ? __eou__ No , I have't got the chance to meet the famous professor yet . __eou__ Oh , he's my uncle.Come to my house at seven this evening . I'll introduce you to him . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I hate this kind of weather ! __eou__ When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . __eou__ I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . __eou__ He said there are only all kinds of good weather . __eou__ Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? __eou__ Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . __eou__ We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? __eou__ I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . __eou__
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__
My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . __eou__ If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course . __eou__ You mean I should please her by following her suggestion . __eou__ Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__ You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__ You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Jack , could you check your calendar ? __eou__ Sure , what's going on ? __eou__ We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . __eou__ Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . __eou__
Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ In what ways ? __eou__ Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible __eou__ Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! __eou__ But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__ But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__
Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ? __eou__ Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's . __eou__ But Bob is more generous and ready to help . __eou__ We cannot judge a man totally by that . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
I hate to go outside . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Why do you hate to go outside ? __eou__ I meet too many jerks . __eou__ I agree . __eou__ This city is full of jerks . __eou__ Rude people are everywhere . __eou__ But what can you do ? __eou__ You can yell at them . __eou__ And they will yell back at you . __eou__ Yelling doesn't do any good . __eou__ No . The best thing to do is just stay home . __eou__
Can you give me a ride back home ? __eou__ Sure __eou__
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? __eou__ He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . __eou__ Don't believe him . He's liar . __eou__ We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . __eou__
Mum , I have something for you today . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ Don't you remember ? Today is March 8th . It's Women's Day . __eou__ Oh . I've really forgotten it . __eou__ Now , close your eyes . ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand . ) __eou__ A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son . __eou__ Happy Women's Day . I love you forever , Mum . __eou__
Do you like flowers ? __eou__ Of course , I like . __eou__ What's your favorite flower ? __eou__ Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . __eou__ Spring is a lively season . __eou__ Yes . How about you ? __eou__ I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . __eou__ You have a perfect taste ! __eou__ It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . __eou__
Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ? __eou__ Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . __eou__
Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? __eou__ How long would you like to keep it ? __eou__ Till the end of the week . __eou__ Yes , that'd be all right . __eou__
Thank you so much . I can't take this . __eou__ She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it . __eou__ What did she mean just now about raising pigs ? __eou__ Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” __eou__ Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . __eou__ She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly . __eou__
Do you watch a lot of TV ? __eou__ Not really . I could take it or leave it . __eou__ Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__
How are you doing , Andrew ? __eou__ Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__ But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? __eou__ You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . __eou__ What about me ? I ’ m your friend . __eou__ I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__ What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . __eou__ People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . __eou__ That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__
Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? __eou__ Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . __eou__ What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? __eou__ We should choose from the backups . __eou__ That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . __eou__ That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . __eou__ Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? __eou__ I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . __eou__ Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . __eou__ Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? __eou__ Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . __eou__ Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? __eou__ Yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? __eou__ I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . __eou__
What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . __eou__
What kind of books do you like ? __eou__ I like reading novels about early America . __eou__ Really ? Me too . __eou__ Which one do you like best ? __eou__ I prefer the novels by Hemingway , such as The Old Man and the Sea . I like the simple words in his novels . __eou__ Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . __eou__ Absolutely ! __eou__
B , what's in your hand ? __eou__ Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ Why do you read them ? __eou__ As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . __eou__ I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ Correct ! What about you , Fred ? __eou__ I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ Don't overdo it . __eou__ Shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ I get drunk easily . __eou__
Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . __eou__ But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM . __eou__ Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! __eou__ What other features are listed ? __eou__ It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . __eou__ Totally cool colors ! __eou__ And it says that it sleeps . __eou__
Did you listen to the weather forecast ? __eou__ No.Why ? __eou__ There ’ s a typhoon coming . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
What's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . __eou__ Is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . __eou__
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__ But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ Thanks for coming . __eou__ How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . __eou__ Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . __eou__ Well . I really do have to go . __eou__ Good night then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__
Japanese is easy to learn . __eou__ You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . __eou__ I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . __eou__ You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . __eou__
This paper absorbs water so quickly ! __eou__ Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills . __eou__
What's the problem ? You don't look happy . __eou__ I failed my oral test . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I'm not practicing enough . __eou__ Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ? __eou__ When I talk to Chinese , I always want to speak Chinese . __eou__ You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
I don't know about you , but I am famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? __eou__ That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? __eou__ I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot . __eou__ You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ? __eou__ Sure . If I could , I would eat hot pot every day ! __eou__ Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? __eou__ Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner ! __eou__ Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . __eou__ Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? __eou__ No ... __eou__ Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? __eou__ That's it ! That ’ s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! __eou__ You really have a big head , don't you . __eou__
I like your sweater . It suits you very well . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . __eou__ She certainly has the taste . __eou__
May I invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't dance . __eou__ Never mind , I can teach you . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ No , it is easy . __eou__ How should I do ? __eou__ You just follow me . __eou__ All right . By the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ Yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ It seems a good way . __eou__
I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . __eou__ Easy come , easy go . __eou__
What was the party like last night , Jean ? __eou__ Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? __eou__ Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ How many did you use to take ? __eou__ Three every night . __eou__ Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__ Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ I'm sure you did . __eou__ The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__ He was quite right . __eou__ So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . __eou__
Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . __eou__ Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? __eou__ We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__ A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . __eou__ Was he disqualified ? __eou__ Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__
Nice to see you , Patrick . __eou__ Bob ! I hear your team won the match . __eou__ Yeah . All of us tried our best . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__
He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? __eou__ I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . __eou__ As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . __eou__ True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? __eou__ Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? __eou__
So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . __eou__ And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard this one before . __eou__ But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__ Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__ Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? __eou__
Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . __eou__ I am very pleased to meet you . __eou__ Bob is in advertising . __eou__ That sounds an interesting job , Bob . __eou__
John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . __eou__ I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . __eou__ You can't be serious ! __eou__ Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__ After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__ Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! __eou__ Whatever you say ! __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . __eou__ Is your brother older or younger than you ? __eou__ He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . __eou__
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__ Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__ Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ What were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__ Too bad . __eou__
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ May I introduce myself ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . __eou__ Nice to meet you , John . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . __eou__
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . __eou__ Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . __eou__ Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? __eou__ I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . __eou__ Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . __eou__ I guess that you will really be dressing down . __eou__ That's my style when I'm not in the office . __eou__ Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . __eou__
When is your vacation going to start ? __eou__ I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation __eou__ Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? __eou__ I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . __eou__ Where are you going now . __eou__ To the beach __eou__ Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? __eou__ Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends __eou__ You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August __eou__ Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . __eou__
Are you tired ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__
You missed the film.That ' s a shame . __eou__ Is it stimulating ? __eou__ Yes . I got very excited . __eou__ I hope I still have chances . __eou__
How are your parents these days ? __eou__ Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . __eou__ Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . __eou__ Sure , thank you . __eou__
I had a great time on the last date . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__ What will you up to this weekend ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ would you like to go to skating ? I was thinking of going out to the - - Saturday . It's great up there . Would you like to go with me ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much . __eou__ Ok , there is a bunch of going bowling on Sunday . Would you like to go ? __eou__ I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you . __eou__ Would you like to dancing tonight ? __eou__ I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart . __eou__ I miss you too . Tell me where you like to do the next day . __eou__ How about the seaside ? __eou__ Anything you say , honey . __eou__ Are you busy on the 24th ? __eou__ 24th ? I have time . But I can't wait that long , I'm dying to see you . Let's make another time . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? __eou__ It's Beethoven . Do you like it ? __eou__ I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? __eou__ I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ What other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ What kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ I like pop music . Do you ? __eou__ Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . __eou__ How long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ So , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . __eou__ Do you still play piano ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of my hobbies . __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
Mike has changed much after marriage . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . __eou__ It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . __eou__
What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? __eou__ In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . __eou__ But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . __eou__ Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for . __eou__

I can hardly bear it . __eou__ Calm down ! My little guy ! You'll get used to that after you come here several times . __eou__ Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me . __eou__ I'd like a gin and tonic . __eou__
Out of every movie that you've seen , which one is your favorite ? __eou__ I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever . __eou__ You think so , how come ? __eou__ Well , Superbad is super funny . __eou__ You're not lying , I found that movie absolutely hilarious . __eou__ I didn't know that you saw Superbad before . __eou__ I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out . __eou__ I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie . __eou__ I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards . __eou__ That's exactly how I felt . __eou__ I got the movie when it came out on DVD , do you want to come over ? __eou__ I would love to . __eou__
Hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? __eou__ Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . __eou__ You're the first guest to arrive .

How long have you been living here now ? __eou__ Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? __eou__ Sure , what do you have ? __eou__ I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . __eou__ I'll have a glass of red wine please . __eou__ One glass of red wine coming up ! __eou__ So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? __eou__ There's just going to be 6 of us tonight . __eou__ Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? __eou__ Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . __eou__ That's too bad.They ' re such good company . __eou__ I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that . __eou__
What a brilliant smile ! __eou__ That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling . __eou__ He must be very easy-going . __eou__ Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . __eou__
The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? __eou__ Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice In Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily __eou__ How about here in Beijing ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn __eou__ I feel it ’ s rather dry here __eou__ That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . __eou__ Are you from south ? __eou__ No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . __eou__ I see . So this is your hometown ? __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What is the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil three to zero . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__

I'll have to go now . __eou__ Drop in if you're free.Bye for now ! __eou__ See you . __eou__
How come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? __eou__ I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__ As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking . __eou__ Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager . __eou__ I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . __eou__
Did you see the fashion awards last night ? __eou__ I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . __eou__ Not interested ? __eou__ Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . __eou__ But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . __eou__ All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . __eou__ Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? __eou__ What , it keeps coming back ? __eou__ Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . __eou__ Flares ? __eou__ They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . __eou__ It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__ That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . __eou__
Victoria , you are back from vacation ! How was it ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I feel tired . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I had to visit all my relatives . __eou__
Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? __eou__ Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . __eou__ Well , then join us some other time . __eou__ Yeah . Thanks . And have fun ! __eou__
What do you think of the former champ ? __eou__ There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it . __eou__ No champion can remain at the top for ever . __eou__ I suppose he's not in top form . __eou__
He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know . __eou__ You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? __eou__ No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . __eou__
Hi , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Don . What a surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . __eou__ Have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week . __eou__
I like football best of all . __eou__ Do you ? __eou__ It's a very good game . __eou__ Do you watch it or do you still play it ? __eou__ I only watch now . __eou__
Susan is going to get a divorce . __eou__ How do you know that ? __eou__ She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . __eou__ Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . __eou__
Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? __eou__ Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? __eou__ Not bad thanks . __eou__ Good . See you ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Which one of them is Marys brother ? __eou__ The one with a very big nose . __eou__ I'd like to meet him.Will you introduce him to me ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
So do you think I can take it ? __eou__ I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . __eou__ I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . __eou__ See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
Do you know who that tall man is ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because everyone is trying to butter him up . __eou__
He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? __eou__ You can't judge a book by its cover . __eou__
Plastic bags are widely used nowadays . __eou__ But they're hard to be disposed of . __eou__ In this aspect , I think , Pater bags have the edge on plastic bags . __eou__
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'll leave at 10 o'clock . __eou__ Take care and give my best to you parents . __eou__ Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . __eou__ I know . But I couldn ’ t help . __eou__
George speaks Japanese better than Frank . __eou__ Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank . __eou__ Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . __eou__
I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . __eou__ How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? __eou__ Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . __eou__ Why don't we just make it a friendly game ? __eou__ Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . __eou__
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . __eou__
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! __eou__
Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? __eou__ Speaking . What's up ? __eou__ Why haven't you answered the phone ? __eou__ My bad , I had chores to do . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__ What was the reason for your call ? __eou__ I want to do something tomorrow with you . __eou__ Sounds good . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking about seeing a movie . __eou__ Okay , let's go see a movie . __eou__ Until then . __eou__ Talk to you later . __eou__
We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . __eou__ That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . __eou__
Hi Julie , how are things going ? __eou__ Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? __eou__ I'm doing really well . __eou__ Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? __eou__ Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? __eou__ That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . __eou__ I thought that he was with Malia . __eou__ Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . __eou__ I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! __eou__ Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . __eou__
Lee , I'm going to get married next month . __eou__ Good news ! And congratulations ! __eou__ You are invited to my wedding . __eou__ Thank you . I'll certainly be there . __eou__
Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ It seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . __eou__ I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__ I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? __eou__ I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . __eou__
He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . __eou__ Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . __eou__
Are you working or are you a student ? __eou__ I'm a student . __eou__ Which school are you studying at ? __eou__ Tsinghua University . __eou__
Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ? __eou__ Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ? __eou__ Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ? __eou__ I didn ’ t think much of it . Are you ? __eou__ Sure . Would you like go with me ? __eou__ Sounds like fun . __eou__ You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though . __eou__ Are you broke again ? Let me treat you . __eou__ Wow ! When did you come into so much cash ? __eou__ You know , I am a waitress at the student center . Anyway now those final exams are almost over . I ’ d love a night out . __eou__
So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__
I ’ Ve got a new boss . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s he like ? __eou__ Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And a white sports car . __eou__ Um , that ’ s good . __eou__ Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . __eou__
Can I borrow your suit ? __eou__ That's out of the question . __eou__
hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__ do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ thank you . __eou__
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? __eou__ Okay ! What do you suggest ? __eou__ How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . __eou__ Is that so ? Why not ? __eou__ ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . __eou__ What's on ? __eou__ Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? __eou__ Ah . The Royal , I think . __eou__ What time does it start ? __eou__ Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . __eou__ But we won't have enough time for dinner . __eou__ Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? __eou__ Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . __eou__ Then , there's a 9:30 show . __eou__ That's Okay , I think . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Could you introduce to me the man over there ? __eou__ Certainly.Let ' s to and meet him now . __eou__ You're so kind . __eou__
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . __eou__ Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__ Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__ Make yourself at home . __eou__ It is such a nice place . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . __eou__ Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . __eou__ Gambling ? Where ? __eou__ Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . __eou__ If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . __eou__
You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ? __eou__ No problem . Wait a moment . __eou__
Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? __eou__ I'd like that very much . __eou__ How does 7:30 sound ? __eou__ Fine . See you later . __eou__
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK . __eou__

I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? __eou__ It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . __eou__ Who was the conductor ? __eou__ Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . __eou__ Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . __eou__ Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . __eou__ Obviously you did enjoy the concert . __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__
Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? __eou__ Sure , here you go . __eou__ Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . __eou__ Of course . There you are . __eou__ Thanks so much . I owe you one . __eou__
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? __eou__ Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Swimming . What about you ? __eou__ Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . __eou__
Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__ My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__ Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ You need a babysitter . __eou__ Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . __eou__ I could have Suzy stay at my place . __eou__ I don't want to do that to you , Karen . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . __eou__ I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . __eou__ I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . __eou__ I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . __eou__ I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__ I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__ Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__ Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__ You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__
I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . __eou__ Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . __eou__
You don't look too well . What's going on ? __eou__ I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? __eou__ I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . __eou__ That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? __eou__ She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . __eou__ I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__ No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . __eou__
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ That depends . What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ How tall is she ? __eou__ She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ Is she chubby ? __eou__ Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__ It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ How's her skin ? __eou__ She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos __eou__ What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . __eou__ Even her mom ? __eou__ Yes , even her mom . __eou__ What's her personality like ? __eou__ She's a lot like me . __eou__ So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
Do you live with your parents ? __eou__ No , they live in Shanghai , my hometown . __eou__ How often do you go back to visit them ? __eou__ Once a year . __eou__
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! __eou__
I'm dreadfully sorry for you . __eou__ Thank you very much for your kindness . __eou__ Is there any clue ? __eou__ No , he left nothing . __eou__

Take a look at the advertisement . __eou__

I have to meet someone . __eou__ It's been nice talking to you . __eou__ Good-bye . See you again sometime . __eou__
I ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ Do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . __eou__ Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m a singer . __eou__ Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__ Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? __eou__
Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? __eou__ Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . __eou__ Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . __eou__
Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? __eou__ Not really ! __eou__ Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . __eou__ Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . __eou__ Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . __eou__
That is the most beautiful sunset ! __eou__ Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . __eou__ Here is a good place . Let's get out . __eou__ Wow .

Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? __eou__ Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet . __eou__ People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__ You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__ There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__ Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__ Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . __eou__ Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__ I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__ I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__ Don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . __eou__
What are you doing , awake ? __eou__ I can't sleep ... __eou__ But it's almost midnight ! __eou__ Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . __eou__ Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? __eou__ Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! __eou__ Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! __eou__ O-K ... __eou__ Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! __eou__
Tom , did you see the film last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? __eou__ Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . __eou__ Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . __eou__
Here , Let me get the door for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__

What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__ Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__ Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__ Hope you feel better . __eou__
So how did you like the restaurant ? __eou__ Actually , it could have been better . __eou__ What didn't you like about it ? __eou__ It is a new restaurant . I don't think they have their act together yet . __eou__ What did you think about the food ? __eou__ I felt that the food was pretty mediocre . __eou__ The service wasn't that great , either . __eou__ I agree . The service was not good . __eou__ Do you think that you want to try this restaurant another time ? __eou__ No , I think that I've had enough of this restaurant . __eou__
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . __eou__
What's the name of the series just showed ? __eou__ Doctor Butcher . __eou__ What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? __eou__ No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . __eou__
It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . __eou__ Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? __eou__ Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . __eou__ Fortunately , things are changing these years . __eou__
I'm going to see the doctor this weekend . __eou__ What's your trouble ? __eou__ I think I need a thorough check-up . __eou__ I got it . __eou__
Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? __eou__ Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . __eou__ Really ? What was the matter ? __eou__ You knew Brain Locker ? __eou__ Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? __eou__ Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . __eou__ Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? __eou__ I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . __eou__ Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . __eou__ Stop complaining , OK ? __eou__ No wonder you are named shopaholic . __eou__ No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . __eou__ Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . __eou__
They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday . __eou__ But Saturday is my birthday . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . __eou__ But it won ’ t be on my birthday . __eou__ But your health is more important . Believe me ! __eou__
Did you hear peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? __eou__ No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . __eou__ What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? __eou__ Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . __eou__ That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . __eou__ Let's try it ! __eou__
When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . __eou__ Your dream comes true now . __eou__ Yes , I knew I would make it . __eou__ You are really confident . __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . __eou__
Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . __eou__ Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . __eou__ Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . __eou__ It's normal . Time will change everything . __eou__
Jim was late again . __eou__ It's not like him to be late . __eou__
Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
Merry Christmas , Bill ! __eou__ Merry Christmas . Steven ! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ? __eou__ I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ? __eou__ I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Hey Eve , how are you ? __eou__ I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? __eou__ I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! __eou__ Do you have a lot of homework ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you ? __eou__ Of course I do ! __eou__ Which class are you working on right now ? __eou__ I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . __eou__ Are you in Mrs . Green ’ s class ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! __eou__ Do you want to study together ? __eou__ Sure . This library is too quiet though . __eou__ Do you want to go to an empty classroom ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ OK . Let ’ s go ! __eou__
Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! __eou__ Hi , Alex ! __eou__ Where have you been ? __eou__ I just got back from London . __eou__ How was your flight ? __eou__ It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ? __eou__ It was 10 hours . __eou__ Did you have a layover ? __eou__ Yes , in paris , France . __eou__ Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you ! __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ It was nothing . __eou__
Don't you ever cheat on me . __eou__ Why would I do that ? __eou__ Because men like to cheat . __eou__ Some men do , but not me . __eou__ I'm watching you . __eou__ I'm an open book . Watch me all you want . __eou__ If I catch you , you'll be sorry . __eou__ You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater . __eou__ I will poke your eyes out . __eou__ I don't want any other woman . __eou__ I will chop your toes off , one by one . __eou__ Honey , please . You're the only woman for me , forever . I swear it . __eou__
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . __eou__
We quarreled yesterday , and he picked up and left . __eou__ Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ? __eou__ I am not sure . __eou__ Don ’ t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him . __eou__
Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper . __eou__ Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet . __eou__ I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave . __eou__ Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . __eou__
Well , what brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my aunt . __eou__ Does she live nearby ? __eou__ Yes . She lives on the next block . __eou__
Do you consider yourself a good mother ? __eou__ Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . __eou__ How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . __eou__ I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . __eou__ Does your husband feel the same ? __eou__ Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . __eou__
Has your family lived here for long ? __eou__ Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . __eou__ You have a fantastic view . __eou__ Yes . I love living here . __eou__ Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . __eou__ Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . __eou__
I'm happy to see you again . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Okay , I'll give you a ring next week . __eou__
Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . __eou__ Yes , it has been a long time ! __eou__ How long has it been since we last saw each other ? __eou__ I think that we last saw each other two years ago . __eou__ What have you been doing for the past two years ? __eou__ I have been going to graduate school at USC . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I am studying international communications . __eou__ You should easily be able to find a job with that major . __eou__ I am counting on being able to get a good job . __eou__
What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . __eou__
Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ? __eou__ Of course . I often go to the movies . __eou__ There ’ s a good movie called Summer in Beijing . __eou__ I heard it ’ s a very good movie . __eou__ Let ’ s find out what time it starts . __eou__ Let ’ s look at the newspaper . __eou__ Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock . __eou__ Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . __eou__
Whatever we do , we should do it above board . __eou__ You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . __eou__ Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . __eou__
I like NBA very much . __eou__ Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U . S . ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ Do you like NBA ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Who do you like best of the NBA players ? __eou__ Kobe . __eou__ So do I . __eou__ Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__
The Blacks got divorced . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . __eou__ Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? __eou__ No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . __eou__ Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? __eou__ No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up . __eou__ I like that joke , but I hope it's true . __eou__
The winter in Ottawa is freezing . __eou__ From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa . __eou__ I think I will be adapted to it . __eou__ Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm . __eou__ Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . __eou__ What's wrong with her . __eou__ She is expecting . __eou__ Congratulations to you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__
Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . __eou__ But yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__ I ’ Ve changed my mind . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . __eou__
You look really nice today . __eou__ Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day . __eou__ Really , where did you get it ? __eou__ I got it from Macy's . __eou__ It's really nice . __eou__ Thanks again . You look nice today , too . __eou__ Thank you . I just got these shoes today . __eou__ Really ? What kind of shoes are they ? __eou__ These are called All Star Chuck Taylors . __eou__ I really like those . How much did they cost ? __eou__ They were about forty dollars . __eou__ I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . __eou__
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
What stresses you out the most ? __eou__ Probably my parents . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ Your parents are not like that ? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . __eou__
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? __eou__ I'd enjoy that . __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . __eou__ OK . I'll see you then . __eou__
Are you ready for the camping trip ? __eou__ All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ... __eou__ Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature . __eou__ Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ? __eou__ I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack . __eou__ Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ? __eou__ That's trail mix ! __eou__ Same difference . What's this ? __eou__
Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__
What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? __eou__ Probably nothing . __eou__ You have to do something romantic . __eou__ Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means . __eou__ Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . __eou__
You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . __eou__ I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . __eou__ Do you feel ok ? __eou__ Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . __eou__ Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__ Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? __eou__ You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . __eou__ Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . __eou__ Zach , what's that on your arm ? __eou__ I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . __eou__ It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? __eou__ Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__ I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . __eou__ Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! __eou__
Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to . __eou__ Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again . __eou__ Let's keep in touch . __eou__ Sure , let's . Goodbye , then . __eou__
I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , he did the same to me . __eou__
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__
I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is . __eou__ I'm on your side . It needs to be done over . __eou__
Mary , do you remember when we met ? __eou__ I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... __eou__ And I came up and asked to sit by you ... __eou__ Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . __eou__
What would you like for Christmas ? __eou__ I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . __eou__ Have you asked Santa ? __eou__ Yes and I've written him a letter . __eou__
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? __eou__ I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? __eou__ sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? __eou__ I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? __eou__ I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . __eou__ that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . __eou__
John got a heart attack last night . __eou__ Oh really ? Is he all right ? __eou__ Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . __eou__ Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . __eou__ It's 8 sharp by my watch . __eou__ Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . __eou__
Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? __eou__ I'm going out this Saturday . __eou__ Do you already have a foursome ? __eou__ Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . __eou__ That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? __eou__ We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . __eou__ How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . __eou__ How much does it cost over there ? __eou__ Twilight rates are 21 dollars . __eou__ That's pretty good . Let's do it . __eou__ Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 __eou__ Make it 4 __eou__ Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time . __eou__ Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then . __eou__ Aright . Have fun on Saturday . __eou__ Will do . __eou__
John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news ! __eou__ Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning . __eou__ I am . Don ’ t worry about getting your wallet . It ’ s my treat . __eou__ This is a first ! You must have won the lottery . __eou__
Do you enjoy going on dates ? __eou__ Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . __eou__ What's so fun about them ? __eou__ They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . __eou__ So you always have fun on dates ? __eou__ Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ My date may not be my type . __eou__ So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? __eou__ I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . __eou__ Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . __eou__ Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . __eou__
Gucci , you look serious . I wish you ’ d let your hair down . __eou__ Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed . __eou__
What day is today ? Tuesday ? __eou__ Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ? __eou__ I bet it's May 5th . __eou__
Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! __eou__ Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . __eou__ Can't Elvin handle it ? __eou__ I think he's got too much on his plate . __eou__
We'd like a half-day package . __eou__ We offer many different sea water treatments . __eou__ How many can we choose ? __eou__ The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . __eou__ We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . __eou__ OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . __eou__
Do you have any plan on your mind ? __eou__ I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . __eou__ How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? __eou__ By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? __eou__
Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ You can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . __eou__ What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? __eou__ If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . __eou__ Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . __eou__ Let's go ask about it . __eou__
I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . __eou__ That ’ s a matter of opinion . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . __eou__
And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof . __eou__ That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? __eou__ See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . __eou__ You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . __eou__ Nothing ? __eou__ Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . __eou__ You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . __eou__ Engaged ? __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Are you crazy ? __eou__ What ? I thought you liked Patricia . __eou__
He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . __eou__ I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . __eou__ Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . __eou__
Would you like to introduce me to Mr.Johnson ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! __eou__
Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . __eou__ That's wonderful . Congratulations . __eou__ Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . __eou__ I'd love to . What date is it ? __eou__ It's May 1st . __eou__ What day is that ? __eou__ It's Saturday . Could you make the time ? __eou__ Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ? __eou__ At nine sharp . __eou__ Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
What do you think of this suit ? Do I look good or what ? __eou__ You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner . __eou__ Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ? __eou__ Yes , but not the Ritz Carlton , the " Ritz " is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor . __eou__ In that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes . __eou__ I'll wait right here for you Superman . __eou__ Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz ! __eou__ Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit ? __eou__
Does your girl friend like swimming ? __eou__ Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . __eou__ Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . __eou__ But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke __eou__ Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . __eou__ I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . __eou__ Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . __eou__ That's good . __eou__
Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? __eou__ I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . __eou__ Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold . __eou__ I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . __eou__
Hello , Betty , how are you ? __eou__ Quite well , Tom.And you ? __eou__ Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? __eou__ He's much better today . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that.Bye . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
Did you hear about Lulu ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . __eou__ Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! __eou__ No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . __eou__
Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? __eou__ No , what happened ? __eou__ They had an argument and split up . __eou__ Really , what's going to happen now ? __eou__
What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . __eou__ Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . __eou__ Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? __eou__ It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . __eou__ Ok , I will go there myself . __eou__ Sorry , Mr . Polly . __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? __eou__ Have a try . __eou__
Hi , Tim , any news about your job interview ? __eou__ Yeah , I didn't get the job in the end . __eou__ Oh , what a pity ! __eou__ It's ok , that's life . __eou__
He loves that blonde girl . __eou__ Yes , he once gave her seven roses . __eou__ Did she accept it ? __eou__ No way to know . __eou__
OK . Everything is in the bag . __eou__ Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . __eou__
A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ? __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? __eou__ It's a feature film . __eou__ Oh , I've no interest in such films . __eou__
Good morning ! __eou__ Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! __eou__ That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__ I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__ That's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__ For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__ Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . __eou__ Ok , I'll try that . __eou__ Is there anything else bothering you ? __eou__ Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . __eou__ Do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__ I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . __eou__ Try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__ You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! __eou__
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__ can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__ actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . __eou__ addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ absolutely . __eou__ do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__ do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__ yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__ now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . __eou__
Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . __eou__ Then you must hurry up.There ' s only ten minutes left . __eou__ Until we meet again . __eou__
How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? __eou__ Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! __eou__ Do you know why that is ? __eou__ Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . __eou__
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! __eou__
I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . __eou__ I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please . __eou__ How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . __eou__ You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . __eou__ It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . __eou__ I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you . __eou__ Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . __eou__ I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time . __eou__ I just don't trust you any more . __eou__
I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . __eou__ I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . __eou__
I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . __eou__ I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? __eou__ I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ What a good idea ! __eou__
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Have a seat . __eou__
Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? __eou__ My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . __eou__ Is it really completely flat ? __eou__ Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__ Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . __eou__ There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__
My wife gave birth to our first child today . __eou__ Wow ! I'm so happy for you . __eou__
It's too hot to read . __eou__ We'd better go out for a walk . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ Spring . __eou__ How about summer ? __eou__ I dislike it most . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the hottest season is summer in a year . __eou__ But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . __eou__
Hey , Zina . You're here early today . __eou__ Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . __eou__ I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . __eou__ Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . __eou__ Fair enough.Keep up the good work . __eou__
On Saturday night I ’ m going to have a small get-together . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Would you like to come ? __eou__ Do you mean this Saturday ? __eou__ Yes , this coming Saturday . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s too bad . __eou__ Well , perhaps , another time . __eou__
... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . __eou__ With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . __eou__ Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! __eou__ This one ? __eou__ That ’ s my index finger ! __eou__ Oh , right . This one , right ? __eou__ Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . __eou__ Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! __eou__ That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! __eou__
It's raining . __eou__ Oh , no ! Not again . __eou__
I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . __eou__ What's the big deal ? __eou__
Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . __eou__ Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . __eou__ It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . __eou__ Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . __eou__
Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . __eou__ Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? __eou__ Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . __eou__ Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . __eou__
Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? __eou__ Temple fair ? __eou__ Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! __eou__ Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . __eou__ I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? __eou__ What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . __eou__ Great ! Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__
Could you please stop flipping the channels ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry . __eou__
I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . __eou__ Keep in touch ! __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Nice to see you , Patrick . __eou__ Bob ! I hear your team won the match . __eou__ Yeah . All of us tried our best . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? __eou__ My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__ Did you finish typing yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__ Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__ How about the shelf ? __eou__ I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? __eou__ Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . __eou__ I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__ Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__ You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__ My poor memory . Thank you very much . __eou__
hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? __eou__ not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . __eou__ I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ Really ? What's the series about ? __eou__ well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__ it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__ OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__
Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? __eou__ What time do you open this evening ? __eou__ We open at 6:30 , sir . __eou__ I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . __eou__ Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? __eou__ I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . __eou__ Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? __eou__ Davis . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Davis . __eou__ Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . __eou__ I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . __eou__ I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . __eou__ We'll try our best . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
The boss is mad at you . __eou__ Who cares ? __eou__
Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? __eou__ No , I only know four great beauties of China . __eou__ There were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__ Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ Then who were they ? __eou__ Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . __eou__ It seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . __eou__
Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? __eou__ Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__ A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . __eou__ You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__ Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . __eou__ Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? __eou__ Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . __eou__ 8 pm , that's fine with me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . __eou__ Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . __eou__ Ok , George . Bye ! __eou__ Bye , Ann ! __eou__
What does your mother do , may I ask ? __eou__ My mother works in a company as an accountant . __eou__ Is she busy ? __eou__ Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . __eou__
We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? __eou__ Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! __eou__ How fun ! Can I bring something ? __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . __eou__ I make a mean potato salad ! __eou__ Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! __eou__ Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! __eou__
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? __eou__ Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . __eou__
Do you like ice skating ? __eou__ I have never tried it . __eou__ Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . __eou__ Sorry , I don't think I can . __eou__ Friday then . How about it ? __eou__ Friday is great . __eou__ It's settled then . __eou__
Hey , Lily ! You won't believe what happened in class today ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! __eou__ Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! __eou__ Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? __eou__ Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die . __eou__
It seems to be clearing up . __eou__ It's such a nice change . __eou__ I really don't think this weather will last . __eou__ Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again . __eou__
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . __eou__
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Are you going to Helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so I think it should be ok ? __eou__ Are you taking anything ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . __eou__ Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__ I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! __eou__ Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at Helen ’ s . __eou__
What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music . __eou__ What kinds of sports do you like ? __eou__ I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball . __eou__ Who is your favorite author ? __eou__ I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation . __eou__ Are you a music lover ? __eou__ Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works . __eou__ What kinds of films do you enjoy ? __eou__ I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . __eou__
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . __eou__ Are you sure of that ? __eou__ I am not certain about that . __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it . __eou__
I think your speech was excellent . __eou__ Was it ? __eou__ Sure it was . __eou__ Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . __eou__ But you did it and did it well ! __eou__
The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? __eou__ I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . __eou__ That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__ I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . __eou__
The country is strong only in appearance . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . __eou__ You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact . __eou__
Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day . __eou__ How's he doing ? __eou__ Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week . __eou__ He did ? That's too bad ! __eou__ I think so , too . __eou__ Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him . __eou__ I'll be sure to do that . __eou__
Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious . __eou__ It's okay . __eou__ Next time , it's on me . __eou__ Don't be silly . __eou__ I'm serious . __eou__ Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors . __eou__ Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . __eou__ Definitely . I really like Italian food . __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? __eou__
I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . __eou__ Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . __eou__ I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . __eou__ Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? __eou__ I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . __eou__
We are through . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . __eou__ I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . __eou__ But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . __eou__ That girl was my cousin . __eou__ You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . __eou__ I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . __eou__ I don't buy a story . __eou__ I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . __eou__ No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . __eou__
Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? __eou__ Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? __eou__ Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? __eou__ That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? __eou__ To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ What do you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__ Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . __eou__ That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__ It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? __eou__ Sounds good . I'll see you then ! __eou__
Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__
You really look familiar . __eou__ Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? __eou__ My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? __eou__ Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland . __eou__ That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin ! __eou__ It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big . __eou__ It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ? __eou__ I always make time for family . __eou__
What do you think of this one ? __eou__ Eh , so so . __eou__ And this one ? Too flashy ? __eou__ Nah , not too flashy . __eou__ Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? __eou__ I guess . __eou__ Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . __eou__ And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__ Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__ Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__
I've never met anyone like Clyde before . __eou__ He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . __eou__ Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . __eou__ You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” __eou__ Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! __eou__
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . __eou__ I'm wearing my heavy jacket . __eou__ I'm going to put on more clothes , too . __eou__ Will it snow today ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you like snowing ? __eou__ Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . __eou__ You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
What did you do this weekend , Kate ? __eou__ Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . __eou__ That sounds nice . Where did you go ? __eou__ We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ? __eou__ Not really . I just worked on my car all day . __eou__ That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ? __eou__ But then what would I do every weekend ? __eou__
What had make you so upset ? __eou__ Frank has gone out with Lucy again . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? __eou__ Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . __eou__
Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . __eou__ Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? __eou__ Yes , definitely . __eou__ They have moved to some other places long time ago . __eou__ Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . __eou__ Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . __eou__ This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__ Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . __eou__ Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . __eou__ Is that better now ? __eou__ Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . __eou__
Thanks a million . __eou__ My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . ) __eou__
By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? __eou__ Well , it's Thursday today . __eou__ And the date , please . __eou__ The 5th . __eou__
It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . __eou__ Can you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't . __eou__
Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? __eou__ We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . __eou__ Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__ Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ Is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ Was it a very old house ? __eou__ It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ Is it in a good location ? __eou__ The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . __eou__
Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! __eou__ Out of the frying pan and into the fire . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Thanks for coming shopping with me . __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . __eou__ You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . __eou__ Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . __eou__ I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . __eou__ The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? __eou__ These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . __eou__
Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . __eou__ We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? __eou__ It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . __eou__ Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! __eou__ I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . __eou__ Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . __eou__ I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? __eou__
What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . __eou__ I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . __eou__ Let's go . The time is coming . __eou__ We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . __eou__ There's nothing to watch right now . __eou__ I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . __eou__ Me too . Let's get together and do something . __eou__ I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . __eou__ Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . __eou__ That's great . We can do something outdoors then . __eou__ Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . __eou__ Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . __eou__ Do you know what time it starts ? __eou__ It starts at one PM . __eou__ Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . __eou__ Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . __eou__
Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ? __eou__ Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone . __eou__ Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ? __eou__ Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . __eou__ All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . __eou__ You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . __eou__ Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ? __eou__ Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . __eou__
I think this one will do . __eou__ I'm sorry . I don't think so . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong with it ? __eou__ It's much too hard for his age . __eou__
So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . __eou__ That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__ So , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . __eou__
Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? __eou__ As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . __eou__ Are you feeling better ? __eou__ Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . __eou__ Do you need anything , grocery ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . __eou__ Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? __eou__ I'd like both . __eou__
Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? __eou__ Sort of yes . __eou__ But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . __eou__ But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . __eou__
We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? __eou__ What is a sixties party ? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties . __eou__ That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . __eou__ Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? __eou__ That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player ! __eou__
Time flies ! __eou__ You're telling me . __eou__
You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__ Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__ They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__ They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . __eou__
Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . __eou__ Then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . __eou__
Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? __eou__ I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . __eou__ Why didn't you want to go out ? __eou__ I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . __eou__ Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? __eou__ I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it . __eou__
Have you heard the news ? __eou__ No . What happened ? __eou__
The weather has been terrible this week . __eou__ Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . __eou__ Let's hope it clears up . __eou__
Paul , is this Paul , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , well , Mike.Fancy meeting you here . __eou__ Small world , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies ! __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
How was the party yesterday ? __eou__ Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had . __eou__ Why ! what happened ? __eou__ Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . __eou__
Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Which day would suit you ? __eou__ Any day except Tuesday . __eou__ How about Thursday ? __eou__ Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ? __eou__ Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Thank you very much . __eou__ See you on Thursday , then . __eou__
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__
I wish it was a nicer day today . __eou__ That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . __eou__ It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__ It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__ It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . __eou__ Any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__ That's right , it really would be . __eou__ I want it to cool down some . __eou__ I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . __eou__ Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . __eou__ I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ I wish it was a nicer day today . __eou__ That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . __eou__ It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__ It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__ It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . __eou__ Any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__ That's right , it really would be . __eou__ I want it to cool down some . __eou__ I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . __eou__ Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . __eou__ I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ That depends . What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ How tall is she ? __eou__ She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ Is she chubby ? __eou__ Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__ It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ How's her skin ? __eou__ She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . __eou__ What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . __eou__ Even her mother ? __eou__ Yes , even her mother . __eou__ What's her personality like ? __eou__ She's a lot like me . __eou__ So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding . __eou__ That must be a long love story . __eou__ Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young . __eou__ They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ He didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ That's what friends are for . __eou__
Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . __eou__ Me too . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ OK . See you later . __eou__
How time flies ! __eou__ Bill and Betty have already grown up . __eou__ I can still remember our first date . __eou__ Look at that big tree over there . __eou__ Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . __eou__ Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ? __eou__ You seemed to be dull at that time . __eou__ But you agreed to go out with me at last . __eou__ ( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married . __eou__ So do you feel happy now ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! __eou__ Of course , we are the happiest family in the world . __eou__
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . __eou__ Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . __eou__ This situation isn't easy to handle . __eou__
Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . __eou__ Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together . __eou__ I feel life is meaningless without him . __eou__ Cheer up . You have got me at least . __eou__
Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . __eou__ No problem . I can deal with it well . __eou__ You will ask for it . __eou__ All is best now , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? __eou__ He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . __eou__
Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto . __eou__ Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you . __eou__ A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . __eou__ Thank you , they are beautiful . __eou__

So , what kind of music do you like ? __eou__ I like rock a lot . __eou__ Who's your favorite group ? __eou__ The Cranberries . I love their music . How about you ? Do you like them ? __eou__ No , I don't . I can't stand them ! ! __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__
Did you go to the basketball game on Friday ? __eou__ No , I couldn't make it . __eou__ You missed a really good game . __eou__ Oh , really ? Who won ? __eou__ Our school did .

It was really exciting . __eou__ So what was the score ? __eou__ The score was 101-98 . __eou__ Man , that was a really close game . __eou__ That's what made it so great . __eou__ I'll make sure and make it to the next one . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . __eou__ Busy with your work again ? __eou__ Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting . __eou__ I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! __eou__
Can you study with the radio on ? __eou__ No , I listen to background music . __eou__ What is the difference ? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials . __eou__ That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . __eou__
May I invite you for a dance ? __eou__ With pleasure . __eou__ You dance well . Do you breakdance ? __eou__ Me , what brought that on ? __eou__ There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . __eou__ Like disco ? __eou__ Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__ And disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__ Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... __eou__ So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__ You are witty . __eou__
Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . __eou__ Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! __eou__ No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? __eou__ Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . __eou__ That's exactly where I was planning to go ! __eou__ Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . __eou__

I think things are worked out just fine . __eou__

Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? __eou__ Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! __eou__
Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? __eou__ Are you taking anything ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party .

How is your job search going , Janet ? __eou__ I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . __eou__ Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__ I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted . __eou__ Congratulations !

I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ That's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ When are getting married ? __eou__ Some time next year .

Would we have a good time ? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__

You know her father passed away several years ago . __eou__ Maybe her uncle will . __eou__ I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? __eou__ Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes , Jane says they will go to China . __eou__
Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? __eou__ Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? __eou__ How about seven o'clock ? __eou__ Fine.We ' ll be expecting you . __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ May be some other time . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
Mom , Happy mother's Day ! Here's my card . __eou__ What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful . __eou__ Thank you for your love and care over the years , I appreciate it , mom . __eou__ This is the best card I ever received . __eou__ Mom , what can I do for you today ? __eou__ Nothing , son . I'm already very happy . __eou__ How about dinner tonight ? My treat . __eou__ Actually . I prefer we eat at home.We ' ll have more time to catch up that way . __eou__ I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years.Business kept me too busy , I apologize . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you ! __eou__ Thank you , mom . I love you so much ! __eou__
How are you feeling , John ? __eou__ Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . __eou__ Do more exercises after you are healthy . __eou__ Ok , I will . You have said that many times . __eou__ Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? __eou__ No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . __eou__ Good , I can see the library on the map . __eou__ Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__
You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ For me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ What the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ What's new with you ? __eou__ Do you still remember Justin ? __eou__ Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? __eou__ He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ Let me see . What a moving poem ! __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't have much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
Are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
He is planning again . __eou__ Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . __eou__ That is him . __eou__
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try __eou__ that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! __eou__
Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . __eou__ True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . __eou__ I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . __eou__ The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . __eou__ But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . __eou__
Come on , you must tell me everything about him . __eou__ Well , he's very tall and handsome . __eou__ Hmm ... __eou__ He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . __eou__ Oh , how long ? __eou__ Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . __eou__ OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . __eou__ He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He's quite a patient teacher , too . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . __eou__
Your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? __eou__ No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
What's this , I wonder ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . __eou__ A coffee grinder ? __eou__ Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . __eou__ Oh , that would be very useful . __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? __eou__ I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . __eou__ Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ How did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . __eou__ So what do you do there ? __eou__ It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? __eou__ Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... __eou__ Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? __eou__
have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? __eou__ I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . __eou__ you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . __eou__ who's the director ? __eou__ it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ? __eou__ yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ? __eou__ sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . __eou__ that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? __eou__ no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . __eou__ how much does the magadize cost ? __eou__ it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . __eou__ that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? __eou__ Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . __eou__ I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! __eou__
Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! __eou__ I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . __eou__ Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . __eou__ I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . __eou__ So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . __eou__ Don't pull my leg . __eou__ This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? __eou__ Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . __eou__ Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? __eou__ I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . __eou__ Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . __eou__ Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__ He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . __eou__ Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . __eou__ Who knows ! __eou__
What ’ s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy . __eou__ I had a bad day yesterday . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I went to the library and lost my bag . __eou__ Your bag ? Did you get it back ? __eou__ I went back for it . But it was already gone . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . __eou__
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher .

Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! __eou__

I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . __eou__ You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . __eou__ Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . __eou__ Yes . Thanks . __eou__

What a beautiful view . __eou__ It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . __eou__ What is that below ? __eou__ It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish . __eou__ No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me . __eou__ There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . __eou__ Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . __eou__ It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . __eou__ That's true . __eou__

Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__ Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__ Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ It's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? __eou__ Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? __eou__ I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! __eou__ Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job !

I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . __eou__ You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! __eou__ Are you laughing at me ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . __eou__ Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . __eou__ It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . __eou__ So I need to do something too . __eou__ But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . __eou__ I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? __eou__ It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... __eou__ What ? __eou__ I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . __eou__

That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? __eou__ that would be great . thanks . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
What do you do when you are angry ? __eou__ I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . __eou__ That ’ s smart .

Something that could calm your mind . __eou__ I think that might work for me as well . __eou__ Working out is another good way to relieve anger . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . __eou__

What about you ? __eou__ If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . __eou__ If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__ ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__
How's your father been ? __eou__ He's been out of work for a couple of days . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a bad cold . __eou__ Well , tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better . __eou__ Thanks . I'll tell him . __eou__

You know Ernie , it seems we both like the same artists . __eou__ Yes , we do .

I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . __eou__ Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__ Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__ I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ Aren't you tired ? __eou__ No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . __eou__

If you need anything else , please let me know , and I'll be happy to get it for you right away . __eou__
What kind of job have you ever had ? __eou__ I used to work as a teacher . __eou__ How did you like your job ? __eou__ Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . __eou__
Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . __eou__ Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . __eou__ So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? __eou__ Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right . __eou__
Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ? __eou__ I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary .

The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a __eou__
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? __eou__ My grandmother just passed away . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? __eou__ A couple of days ago .

She died in her sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry she's gone . __eou__ At least she didn't suffer . __eou__ I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . __eou__ I know . But I miss her . __eou__ When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . __eou__ Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . __eou__ It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . __eou__ You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . __eou__
What musical instrument do you play ? __eou__ I can play the piano a bit . __eou__ Then we can have one more program at our party ? __eou__ No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . __eou__

You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting .

Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__ that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . __eou__

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . __eou__
How should I dress for the party ? __eou__ Dress casually . __eou__
I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . __eou__ Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . __eou__ Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . __eou__ Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . __eou__ I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . __eou__
You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . __eou__ Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! __eou__ Of course !

How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Jones ! __eou__ Good morning , Miss Bell ! __eou__ Nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time . __eou__ How is everything ? __eou__ Just fine , and you ? __eou__ Quite well , thank you . __eou__ Did you drive yourself to the airport ? __eou__ No , I was driven by my husband . __eou__ Did someone meet you at the airport here ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . __eou__ Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? __eou__ No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . __eou__
Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . __eou__ OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? __eou__ Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . __eou__ Froth ? __eou__ If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . __eou__ Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . __eou__
Check out these wheels ! __eou__ You bought a compact car ? __eou__ No , I borrowed it . __eou__ Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive . __eou__ You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me . __eou__ I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo . __eou__

My major is English . __eou__ How long have you been studying English ? __eou__ More than six years . __eou__ That's a long time . __eou__ Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school . __eou__ No wonder your English is so good . __eou__ Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice . __eou__ I see . Talking with other people is very important . __eou__ Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet . __eou__ I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come . __eou__ Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come . __eou__
What do you think of when you're praying ? __eou__ I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . __eou__ Does that help you faith ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . __eou__ After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? __eou__ She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . __eou__ I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . __eou__ She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that .

It seldom rains this summer . __eou__ Yeah , some places are very short of water . __eou__ Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . __eou__ You see , This time I traveled to the West .

Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . __eou__

Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? __eou__ Maybe it is right since everything is possible .

Her husband is a fat cat . __eou__ But I don't think she really loves him . __eou__ She is only after his money . __eou__ If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . __eou__ But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough . __eou__

How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ There are 15 people in my family . __eou__ What did you say ? How many ? __eou__ 15 people . __eou__ Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? __eou__ Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . __eou__ But you don't live at home anymore . __eou__ Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . __eou__ My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . __eou__ Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis __eou__ Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! __eou__ My aunts and uncles are all teachers . __eou__ You are so lucky ! __eou__ I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__ That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__ I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__ 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__ My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . __eou__
How was the party ? __eou__ I had a fantastic time . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ Of course . Are you a new member here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Welcome . My name is Johnson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ No , I don't . So I need some help . __eou__ Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . __eou__ Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . __eou__ No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . __eou__ I'm ready . __eou__ Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ Alright . Great . __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ Are you alright ? Can you do more ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . __eou__ That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . __eou__ What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? __eou__ Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . __eou__
What's your favorite book ? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind . __eou__ Why do you like it best ? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ Well . I like the Thorn Birds best . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I like the writer's language , too . __eou__ If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . __eou__ Is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . __eou__ What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? __eou__ Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . __eou__
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? __eou__ No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? __eou__ No , Jess , chill out ! __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
So click here , then up to the top . __eou__ Er ... Hum ... Got it . __eou__ Then open that window.Yeah , that one . __eou__ Right ! __eou__ And that's it . You're done . __eou__ I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . __eou__
Ben always appears rude to the people around him . __eou__ But he's really kind at heart . __eou__ That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . __eou__
I've had enough of that ! __eou__ Why , this is the most interesting film ! __eou__ I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . __eou__ But it's only a film . __eou__
Hello . I'm Jason . __eou__ Hi . My name is Dolma . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Dolma . __eou__ Good to meet you too . __eou__
Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? __eou__ It was fun , I tell you . __eou__ Tell me about it , will you ? __eou__ Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! __eou__ Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? __eou__ Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ You were lucky then . __eou__ Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . __eou__ What did you do after that ? __eou__ We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! __eou__ So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . __eou__
Yesterday was April the first . __eou__ Was it quite special ? __eou__ Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . __eou__ Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? __eou__ Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . __eou__ Oh , your classmates took you in . __eou__ Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . __eou__
Why are you laughing ? __eou__ I can't help it . __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ It will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . __eou__ Nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . __eou__ I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . __eou__ You know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . __eou__
How nice it is here __eou__ You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely __eou__ I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year __eou__ That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring __eou__

I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . __eou__ Let's plan a surprise party for him ! __eou__ Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? __eou__ That's easy . Anything else ? __eou__ Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? __eou__ Won't he be surprised ! __eou__ I don't know how old he is though . __eou__ That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! __eou__
Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ? __eou__ Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . __eou__ You are very lucky . __eou__
I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . __eou__ Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__ All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! __eou__ Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . __eou__ But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . __eou__
May I know how old you are ? __eou__ I am 24 . __eou__ What is your date of birth ? __eou__ I was born on April 15 , 1986 . __eou__
Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? __eou__ So I hear . __eou__ Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . __eou__ After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . __eou__
I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . __eou__ Really ? Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ Well , I actually thumbed a lift . __eou__ You what ? __eou__ Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . __eou__ Wow , good for you . __eou__ Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . __eou__ Oh , no ! __eou__ Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . __eou__ You really have bad luck , don't you ? __eou__ Seems like it . __eou__
Hi , what ’ re you reading ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? __eou__ No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ? __eou__ Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . __eou__
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! __eou__ Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ Uh-huh . __eou__ But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . __eou__ A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? __eou__ There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . __eou__ I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . __eou__ What about sunday ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . __eou__ Maybe next week . __eou__ Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . __eou__ Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . __eou__ I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . __eou__
Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ? __eou__ Not yet , I must water the garden first . __eou__ Do you have to water it now ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . __eou__ What a nuisance ! __eou__ Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? __eou__ Yes , Look out of the window . __eou__ It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . __eou__ That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead . __eou__
How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ May I know your name , please ? __eou__ I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ Ah , yes . I remember now.Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ Yes , I was.You work for 3M , right ? __eou__ I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ May I know what you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a fashion designer.Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure.That would be great.Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! __eou__
Sorry.What was that you said ? __eou__ I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At the Gate . __eou__ When , did you say ? __eou__ Round about seven . __eou__ Who's coming ? __eou__ Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside . __eou__ I told you not to forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! __eou__
What ? What ’ s up ? __eou__ Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday . __eou__ Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! __eou__
Are you sure it was him ? __eou__ I used to date him . Of course it was him . __eou__ You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? __eou__ Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . __eou__ Maybe he was just visiting someone . __eou__ But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face . __eou__
How's your mother doing ? __eou__ She is so pretty sick . __eou__ That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ It's Thursday , I think . __eou__ Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . __eou__ We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . __eou__ We'll meet again in a few days . __eou__
Hi , Jack , how have you been ? __eou__ Not very well . __eou__ Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . __eou__ Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . __eou__ Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . __eou__ Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . __eou__ Maybe you're right . __eou__ Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! __eou__ Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... __eou__
May I have a word with you ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ When will you be free ? __eou__ Come by any time . __eou__ Shall I say around ten o'clock ? __eou__ Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . __eou__
I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . __eou__ Many thanks for your presence . __eou__
Mom ? __eou__ Mm ? __eou__ Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? __eou__ Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Is this your new teacher ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Is she short ? __eou__ No , she ’ s average . __eou__ What color are her eyes ? __eou__ They ’ re dark gray . __eou__ What color is her hair ? __eou__ It ’ s blond . __eou__ And how old is she ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
Do you know what E-commerce is ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . __eou__ That's right __eou__ It must be very convenient and pretty quick . __eou__ Sure , but you must have access to the Internet . __eou__
Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? __eou__ I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . __eou__ How do you find the prices there ? __eou__ I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . __eou__ I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? __eou__ Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . __eou__
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ I can speak French and German . __eou__ How well can you speak them ? __eou__ I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . __eou__ Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? __eou__ No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . __eou__
How long have you been in England ? __eou__ For almost two years . __eou__ Almost two years ? Your English is very good . __eou__ Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . __eou__
Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? __eou__ Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan . __eou__ What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . __eou__ The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . __eou__
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? __eou__ No , have they have another fight ? __eou__ No , they got engaged . __eou__ You must be joking.Those two . __eou__ Well , my dear . I didn't believe either.But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning . __eou__ So when did this happen ? __eou__ Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . __eou__ Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? __eou__ Next june . __eou__ I can hardly believe it . __eou__
Hi , how ’ re you doing ? __eou__ Terrible . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . __eou__ Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I should . __eou__ Well , you ’ d better get some rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__
I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . __eou__ He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? __eou__ It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . __eou__ It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . __eou__
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good . Let's go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Do you like traveling ? __eou__ Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . __eou__ Where did you visit ? __eou__ I only had time to visit Edinburgh . __eou__ How did you like it ? __eou__ It's fantastic . __eou__ Why did you go there ? __eou__ I went there on business . __eou__ And do you have friends there ? __eou__ Yes , a lot of friends . __eou__ You must have enjoyed yourself . __eou__ Yes , and I look many pictures . __eou__
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I'm impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . __eou__
William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? __eou__ He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . __eou__ It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? __eou__ I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . __eou__ Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . __eou__
Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? __eou__ OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? __eou__ Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . __eou__ Are you well paid ? __eou__ Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . __eou__ There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . __eou__ That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . __eou__ Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . __eou__ Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . __eou__ First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' __eou__ Be a yes-man , you mean ? __eou__ You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . __eou__ I hope not . __eou__
What are your weekend arrangements ? __eou__ There're many things I can do on weekends . __eou__ What sort of things are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? __eou__ I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . __eou__ That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? __eou__ Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ? __eou__ I'm fond of dancing . __eou__ Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . __eou__
Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? __eou__ I heard it might rain . __eou__ Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills . __eou__ Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . __eou__ Yes that might be a better idea . __eou__ Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . __eou__ Ok - let ’ s do that then ! __eou__
Hi , how is it going ? __eou__ Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__ Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . __eou__
Why did she do that ? __eou__ I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . __eou__
Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__
Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? __eou__ Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? __eou__ Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . __eou__ Great , so what happens now ? __eou__ Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . __eou__
Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . __eou__ I just lost my job . My boss just told me . __eou__ That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? __eou__ I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . __eou__ I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . __eou__
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? __eou__ Yeah how ’ d you know ? __eou__ You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? __eou__ Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . __eou__ It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? __eou__ Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . __eou__ In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . __eou__ Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__ It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
Wei , you look really tired . __eou__ Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . __eou__ 9:00 ! __eou__ Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . __eou__ Why ’ s that ? __eou__ Because too many people in the office are on holiday . __eou__
Are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . __eou__ That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ Is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ Is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? __eou__ I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . __eou__ See ? I told you . It's very hard . __eou__ I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times . __eou__ Fifty times ? __eou__ Yes , it was really stupid . __eou__ And how much did it cost to rent it ? __eou__ It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . __eou__ Well , that's not too bad then . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's expensive ! __eou__ Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . __eou__
How was my singing ? __eou__ Not bad at all . __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__
Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ? __eou__ Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ? __eou__ Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work . __eou__ I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ? __eou__ Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good . __eou__ Which one is that ? __eou__ You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . __eou__ Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . __eou__ Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? __eou__ What time ? __eou__ At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . __eou__ That's good . See you on Friday . __eou__
do you like playing games ? __eou__ I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . __eou__ how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__ the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! __eou__ if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . __eou__ how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? __eou__ I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! __eou__ I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__ hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . __eou__ it's a deal . __eou__ do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? __eou__ yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? __eou__ I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__ I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__ if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__ let's get started with this game then . __eou__ ok . __eou__
I am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__ Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__ Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__ Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
Do you have cold medicine ? __eou__ Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . __eou__ I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? __eou__ Then you can buy Aspirin . __eou__ I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? __eou__ Yes , here this is . __eou__ I'll take it too . __eou__ Thank you and take care . __eou__
This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty . __eou__ So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . __eou__ Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way . __eou__ You got it . __eou__
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__
Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ? __eou__ Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . __eou__ Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today . __eou__ Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . __eou__ Yeah , so are you planning on going ? __eou__ I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ It really does , I can't wait . __eou__ What time does the party start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 o'clock . __eou__ Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . __eou__ Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . __eou__
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you . __eou__
I'm exhausted . My new exercise is so hard . __eou__ I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . __eou__ You thing so ? __eou__ Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? __eou__ Tomorrow morning.Try it . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Are you going to this class this morning ? __eou__ Of course , easy.No sweat . __eou__ You're no able to move after this class . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . __eou__ You want to bet ? __eou__ Yeah , what't the bet ? __eou__ I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . __eou__
Can you tell the result ? __eou__ It's love all . __eou__ Now the score is in our favor . __eou__ Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor . __eou__ Yes.Our guest team is really tough . __eou__ They're still fighting hard.Let ' s wait and see . __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy . __eou__
Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd . __eou__ Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice ! __eou__ Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday . __eou__ I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . __eou__ I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday . __eou__ Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ? __eou__ A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along . __eou__ I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ? __eou__ Nine would be good , don't you think ? __eou__ Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! __eou__
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What does your father do ? __eou__ He is a worker . __eou__ What about your mother ? __eou__ She is a nurse . __eou__
Come on in . Make yourself at home . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? __eou__ I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . __eou__ Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? __eou__ You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? __eou__
Do you often surf the Internet ? __eou__ Yeah . I do it once a week . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . __eou__ Oh , I'll have a try . __eou__
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? __eou__ Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat __eou__ No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? __eou__ Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__ I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__ So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . __eou__ Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . __eou__ Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting . __eou__ Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . __eou__
Any plans tonight ? __eou__ Not really , do you ? __eou__ Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__ Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . __eou__ That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? __eou__ Just did my best . __eou__
There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ What are the movies that are playing ? __eou__ There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . __eou__ I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . __eou__ So , is that a yes ? __eou__ Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? __eou__ It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . __eou__ Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . __eou__ Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . __eou__ She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . __eou__ Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . __eou__
Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . __eou__ Hi , Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__ Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? __eou__ I'm a doctor . __eou__ Oh . Where do you work ? __eou__ New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a teacher . __eou__ What do you teach ? __eou__ I teach English . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At a high school in New Jersey . __eou__ That's nice . How old are you ? __eou__ I'm 32 . __eou__
Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from Greece . __eou__ What's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's very pleasant . __eou__ What's the weather like in spring ? __eou__ It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes . __eou__ What's it like in summer ? __eou__ It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day . __eou__ Is it cold or warm in autumn ? __eou__ It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes . __eou__
Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Where did you have it done ? __eou__ My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? __eou__ Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . __eou__ Well , it looks very nice . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
You have a nice apartment . __eou__ Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . __eou__ She must have done a lot of work on it . __eou__ You bet . __eou__
Did you play football yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I played with Tony and John . __eou__ What did you do after you'd played football ? __eou__ We all went swimming . __eou__ Are you going swimming again this afternoon ? __eou__ No , we aren't . We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers . __eou__ Are you helping him all afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , we are . We can neither play football nor do our homework today . __eou__ You're , going to be very busy . __eou__ Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive . __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . And you ? __eou__ same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . __eou__
Tom , did you see the film last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? __eou__ Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . __eou__ Well , I don't see the point of arguing this . __eou__
Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? __eou__ Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? __eou__ Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . __eou__ Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . __eou__ Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late ! __eou__
Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__
Is this Zhang Lin's home ? __eou__ Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ? __eou__ Yes , please .

How are you doing , Linda ? __eou__ Just fine.Are you busy now ? __eou__ No . I'm just killing time . __eou__ Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ? __eou__ How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ? __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
Did you have a good holiday ? __eou__ Yes and no . __eou__
you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . __eou__ I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . __eou__ do you feel ok ? __eou__ not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . __eou__ why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__ could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? __eou__ you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . __eou__ ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . __eou__ Zach , what's that on your arm ? __eou__ I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . __eou__ it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? __eou__ just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__ I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . __eou__ shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! __eou__
Have you any idea of the prices of ruby and diamond ? __eou__ I'm not very sure.but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond . __eou__ How do you know that ? __eou__ I got it from an encyclopedia . __eou__
Are you ready , honey ? __eou__ Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . __eou__ Just dress formal . __eou__ How about transom ? __eou__ It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . __eou__ Oh , i nearly forget it . __eou__ You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . __eou__
Do you have change for a hundred ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Mike's really angry . __eou__ I wonder Why . __eou__

Where is the concert held this evening ? __eou__ It will be held at the Central Music Hall . __eou__ What is on the program ? __eou__ It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . __eou__ Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! __eou__ Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . __eou__ See you then . __eou__
Happy New Year ! __eou__ Thank you ! The same to you . __eou__ Have you got any plans ? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ? __eou__ My roommate's having a party . __eou__
This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes , I mean it . __eou__ But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__ I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__ But I still love you . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__ Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__ I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__ I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__ I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ Shall we keep pur friendship ? __eou__ Sure , let ’ s just be friends . __eou__
do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . __eou__
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__

Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? __eou__ Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ? __eou__ Well , when will it be convenient for you ? __eou__ This weekend would be OK with me . __eou__
Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight ! __eou__ Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . __eou__ Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? __eou__ My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? __eou__ I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? __eou__ I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? __eou__ camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! __eou__ have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? __eou__ no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . __eou__ it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . __eou__ do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? __eou__ sure , would you like to see them ? __eou__ that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? __eou__ I have a Canon SLR . __eou__ so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . __eou__ I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? __eou__ actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . __eou__ have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? __eou__ yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? __eou__ yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . __eou__ that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? __eou__ how about at 11:00 ? __eou__ sounds great . see you then . __eou__

Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? __eou__ Hello , there , my name is Tonia . __eou__ Do you sing alto ? __eou__ Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . __eou__ Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . __eou__ Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them . __eou__ I heard them warming up earlier . You're right . __eou__ It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! __eou__
Hi , Fanny . __eou__ Hi , Andy . __eou__ Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . __eou__ I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . __eou__ Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? __eou__ My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . __eou__ You have got a great mother . __eou__ I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . __eou__ That sounds good ! __eou__ Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . __eou__ Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . __eou__
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” __eou__ I ’ m on it ! __eou__
How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . __eou__
Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ? __eou__ Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . __eou__ How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable . __eou__ That has nothing to do with it ... __eou__ I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... __eou__ I do . __eou__ Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . __eou__
You look pale recently . __eou__ Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . __eou__ Take good care of yourself . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this ! __eou__ What ? What ’ s the good news ? __eou__ My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him ! __eou__
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . __eou__
The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . __eou__ They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . __eou__ So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . __eou__ Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? __eou__ Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . __eou__ ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? __eou__ Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . __eou__ Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? __eou__ She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . __eou__ Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . __eou__ You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . __eou__ You know , interest is the best teacher . __eou__ So , want me to book the tickets again ? __eou__ Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . __eou__ We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
What are your plans for today ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ? __eou__ I'd like to . See you then . __eou__
Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__ Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__ Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__ A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__ The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__ Great play ! __eou__ We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__ Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! __eou__
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
Hey , check out this new game I bought today . __eou__ Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . __eou__ I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . __eou__ Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching . __eou__ Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films . __eou__

You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? __eou__ Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan . __eou__ Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from China.Are you American ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ? __eou__ Business management __eou__ That sounds interesting . __eou__
Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ Poor Mary ! She really liked him . __eou__ Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ Do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ I hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
He is penny wise and pound-foolish . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . __eou__ Maybe all of us are the same . __eou__
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . __eou__
Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . __eou__ Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . __eou__ What's your meaning ? __eou__ I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . __eou__ You are a thief ? __eou__ No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . __eou__ You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? __eou__ You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness . __eou__ Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . __eou__
How about the matter ? __eou__ I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . __eou__ It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . __eou__ Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . __eou__
Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? __eou__ I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . __eou__ But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! __eou__ Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . __eou__ But ... But ... __eou__ But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn't matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don't care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn't careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don't mind if you want to . __eou__
It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon . __eou__ That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ Great ! __eou__
So , Paula , where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Canada , originally . __eou__ From Canada ? Where were you born ? __eou__ Montreal . __eou__ When did you come to Los Angeles ? __eou__ We moved here when I was fourteen . __eou__ Did you go to school here ? __eou__ Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . __eou__ Did you get a job right after graduation ? __eou__ No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . __eou__ When was that ? __eou__ Let's see ... That was about six years ago . __eou__ I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? __eou__ I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? __eou__
I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . __eou__ Oh my gosh , how exciting ! __eou__ Will you come with me and help me choose ? __eou__ Sure , I will .

It makes you feel really good . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . __eou__ I'm going to take more pictures today . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__

Did you enjoy the movie ? __eou__ Oh , it's really a drag . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . __eou__ Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! __eou__
Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? __eou__ To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . __eou__ Do you mean you got a divorce ? __eou__ Yes , my first marriage was a failure . __eou__
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? __eou__ Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . __eou__ In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? __eou__ My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . __eou__ Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? __eou__ No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__ My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__ Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__ To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__ Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__ But four boys ! __eou__ It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__ You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__ It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__ That's a great idea ! __eou__ We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! __eou__ That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . __eou__

I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . __eou__ Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . __eou__ But I don't even know what to study . __eou__ If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . __eou__ That's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . __eou__ But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice . __eou__
What are you doing over the weekend ? __eou__ I'm planing to go bolling tonight.Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie.What about you ? __eou__ I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend .

But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . __eou__ That ’ s your opinion not mine . __eou__
Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . __eou__ A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? __eou__ The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . __eou__ So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? __eou__ It sounds like it will be . __eou__ I really hope it doesn't get cold . __eou__ That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . __eou__ The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . __eou__ That is true . The weather is constantly changing . __eou__ It would be nice if the weather would never change . __eou__ That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . __eou__ True . Predictable weather would make life easier . __eou__
When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? __eou__ I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__ That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__ That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__ Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . __eou__ Did you ? How is he these days ? __eou__ He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . __eou__ I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? __eou__ Of course . What do you want to move first ? __eou__ Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . __eou__

How about you ? __eou__ Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead . __eou__

How did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . __eou__ How could it be ? __eou__ While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . __eou__ You didn't have an offer ? __eou__ I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . __eou__ I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! __eou__
Hello , Mary . __eou__ Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is ! __eou__
do you have any plans for Friday night ? __eou__ I don't think so . Why ? __eou__ well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? __eou__ sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? __eou__ the more , the merrier ! __eou__ will there be a lot of people there ? __eou__ I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people . __eou__ who else is going to be there ? __eou__ I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school . __eou__ I know your sister . She's very nice . __eou__ don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . __eou__ what time is it going to start ? __eou__ most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . __eou__ should I bring anything ? __eou__ we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . __eou__ I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . __eou__ that'd be great . I'll see you then ! __eou__
Quite a few people are laid off these days . __eou__ Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job . __eou__ University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market __eou__ It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ? __eou__ No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . __eou__
Please fill out the form . __eou__ All right . ... What's the date today , please ? __eou__ It's August the thirteenth . __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . __eou__
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! __eou__ When did you finish ? __eou__ This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! __eou__
Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Dinner ? Where ? __eou__ At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . __eou__ What kind of food do they serve ? __eou__ It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . __eou__ Oh really ! That sounds lovely . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Can you speak Japanese ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school . And I'm still learning it now . __eou__ How long have you been learning it ? __eou__ About three years . __eou__ Can you speak any other languages ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__
Have you met John recently ? __eou__ I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . __eou__ Yes , he has been like that since his accident . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__
What kind of gas does this car take ? __eou__ I don't know . It's a rental . __eou__ I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ? __eou__ Sure , why not ? __eou__ That is the pump you are in front of . __eou__ Is it expensive ? __eou__ It is the most expensive . __eou__ Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ? __eou__ Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little . __eou__ Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ? __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here . __eou__ Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Mary and Tom are breaking up . __eou__ It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? __eou__ Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . __eou__ Do you think they'll become reconciled ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . __eou__ What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . __eou__
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__
What are the good sights to see in Beijing ? __eou__ Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . __eou__
Does your wife work ? __eou__ Yes , she does . She works at home . __eou__ Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? __eou__ Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . __eou__ You are really a hen-pecked husband . __eou__
What are you doing now , Steven ? __eou__ I am reading a book about money management . __eou__ Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . __eou__ Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . __eou__ No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . __eou__ Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . __eou__ Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . __eou__ Thank you for your caring . I will . __eou__ No thanks . __eou__
I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . __eou__ I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . __eou__ How might you spend the weekend . __eou__ I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . __eou__ I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . __eou__ I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . __eou__ Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . __eou__ Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . __eou__ Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . __eou__
Do you remember John from head office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Have you heard what happened to him ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . __eou__ Crikey . Where did this happen ? __eou__ In Taichung , I think . __eou__ Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . __eou__ Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . __eou__ That's terrible . __eou__ Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? __eou__ So what happened next ? __eou__ Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . __eou__ Well , he sure was lucky . __eou__ I'll say . __eou__
What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? __eou__ Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . __eou__ Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . __eou__
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . __eou__ Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ What is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ How many countries have been affected ? __eou__ Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . __eou__ Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . __eou__
I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . __eou__ They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . __eou__ But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
What did you do last vacation ? __eou__ I learned to drive and I got a driving license . __eou__ What will you do this vacation ? __eou__ Travel . __eou__
Are you sure you heard right ? __eou__ Yes , he is running for class president . __eou__ I don't believe you . __eou__ Take my word for it . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
Mom , I didn ’ t have breast . I could eat a horse . __eou__ Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . __eou__

I don't like heat and humidity . __eou__ It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! __eou__ That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__ Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__ There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__ Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early .

I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ what did you argue about ? __eou__ he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__ yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__ well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r __eou__ no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . __eou__ of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better . __eou__ You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary . __eou__ But I make it . __eou__ No , you don't have to spend every penny you make , you could save some every month , like a lot of other people do . __eou__ I work hard so I deserve to enjoy , but that costs money . __eou__ You should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ? __eou__ The problem is that I have no idea . I didn't pay attention . __eou__ Let's bygones be bygones , start saving right now . __eou__
Do you know something about Mount Tai ? __eou__ Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . __eou__ Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? __eou__ Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . __eou__ Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? __eou__ Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . __eou__ I want to see them . How can I go there ? __eou__ That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . __eou__
Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Nothing . I am just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . __eou__ What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . __eou__ I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? __eou__ I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? __eou__

I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel . __eou__ You look great , you are absolutely glowing . __eou__ Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday __eou__
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? __eou__ yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? __eou__ I was at home with my parents in New York City . __eou__ really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? __eou__ I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . __eou__ that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? __eou__ no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . __eou__ did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? __eou__ yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . __eou__ did he survive ? __eou__ unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . __eou__ I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . __eou__ it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . __eou__ terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . __eou__
what sort of music do you like ? __eou__ I love just about anything by Prince . __eou__ so , you're into 80s music then ? __eou__ well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? __eou__ I like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? __eou__ I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . __eou__ I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . __eou__ that's too bad . Maybe another time . __eou__ let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . __eou__ I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? __eou__ sure , what's on ? __eou__ there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . __eou__ that sounds dreadful ! __eou__
Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . __eou__ And what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . __eou__ And you want to know what to wear ? __eou__ Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . __eou__ That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? __eou__ Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . __eou__ My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . __eou__
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? __eou__ I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . __eou__
Daniel . Mind your eye ! __eou__ I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . __eou__
When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__ I thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__
Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . __eou__ Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? __eou__ No , he's living in an old house in Warton . __eou__ Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? __eou__ That's the one . __eou__ His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? __eou__ He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . __eou__ Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? __eou__ No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . __eou__ What a lucky man . __eou__ He still has a complaint though . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . __eou__ The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl . __eou__ Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her . __eou__ Are you sure she is the right girl ? __eou__ Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of . __eou__ What type of girl is she ? __eou__ She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her . __eou__ Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . __eou__
What's your email address ? __eou__ It's bulldog 123 . __eou__ Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ No . That's incomplete . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ What's your mailing address ? __eou__ 456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 . __eou__ That's correct . __eou__ So what's the problem ? __eou__ Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code . __eou__ Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . __eou__
This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
