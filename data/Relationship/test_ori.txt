So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ?

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . __eou__ You are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ No way .

Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ Yes , but whom to ? __eou__ Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . __eou__ That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . __eou__ Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__

I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ No-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it __eou__ I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__ I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - __eou__ Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__

I think Bill Clinton is a good president . __eou__ But he has the sex scandal . __eou__ Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . __eou__ I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . __eou__ Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . __eou__ yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . __eou__
You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? __eou__ He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? __eou__ I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . __eou__ I can think of better things to dream about ... __eou__ Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . __eou__ That's crazy . __eou__
Do you want black or white coffee ? __eou__ White , please __eou__ Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ? __eou__ I don't like Folk music very much . __eou__ What kind of music do you like ? __eou__ I like classical music . Do you ? __eou__ Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep __eou__ I don't believe you . __eou__ It ’ s true . __eou__ You are funny ! __eou__ So are you ! How about another coffee ? __eou__
Ouch ! __eou__ Are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just bumped into the table . __eou__

It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you like best ? __eou__ Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . __eou__ Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__

Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__

We'll bring everything . __eou__
What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an __eou__ Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter .

So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you . __eou__ You are kidding . __eou__ How long have you been working there ? __eou__ A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . __eou__ How do you like your new boss ? __eou__ She is very nice and open-minded . __eou__ Much better than the last one , huh ? __eou__ Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . __eou__ Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . __eou__ Good .

What ’ s the matter , BOB ? __eou__ I think it ’ s my ankle . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks . __eou__ Can you stand ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . __eou__ what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat . __eou__ It ’ s that really necessary ? __eou__ It maybe worse than it seems . __eou__
I've just had an argument with Bob . __eou__ Really , who started the argument ? __eou__ He did and it's his entire fault . __eou__ Did you know it takes two to tango ? __eou__
Is this your umbrella , miss ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__ You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__ Have you ? __eou__ May I ask where you live ? __eou__ Just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__ That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . __eou__ My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . __eou__ It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__ I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__ How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . __eou__ I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__ Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__ No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? __eou__ Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . __eou__ I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . __eou__ Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann . __eou__ Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . __eou__
Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . __eou__ Oh I see . So what did you do then ? __eou__ I washed my car instead . __eou__ Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? __eou__ No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . __eou__
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? __eou__ No , not at all.Go ahead . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ Yes.Is that so important ? __eou__ Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes , I have a three-year-old son . __eou__
Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . __eou__ Yes . Our guest team is really tough . __eou__ They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . __eou__
Where are you going for your trip ? __eou__ I think Hebes is a good place . __eou__ But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . __eou__ How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? __eou__ The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . __eou__ It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
I'd better be going . __eou__ So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's already late . __eou__ Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . __eou__ Thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . __eou__
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__
Tom and Helen got married at last . __eou__ How did you know that ? I heart Tom ’ s father didn ’ t agree with that . __eou__ I was invited to attend their wedding . __eou__ It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it . __eou__ How moving love is . __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ They managed a 99:80 victory . __eou__
Whatever we do , we should do it above board . __eou__ You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . __eou__ Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . __eou__
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . __eou__
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? __eou__ well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__ I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__ there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? __eou__ I could really use a 5 % rise . __eou__ that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . __eou__ listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . __eou__ that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . __eou__ that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? __eou__ of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__ that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__ you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . __eou__
I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight . __eou__ How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? __eou__ Hey , that sounds great . __eou__ Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . __eou__
Michael Jackson's coming to town . __eou__ I Couldn't care less . __eou__
Would you like to join the drama club ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Why do you want to join it ? __eou__ It's very exciting . I think . __eou__
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ it was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? __eou__ yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ what else did you see ? __eou__ art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ you must have had a great time . __eou__ yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__ yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__ that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ you'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . __eou__ How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? __eou__ China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . __eou__ Do you import any food items ? __eou__ Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . __eou__
I like pop music very much . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ Is it ? __eou__
What a good day ! __eou__ Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . __eou__ Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery . __eou__ Great , let's go . __eou__ Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . __eou__ En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it . __eou__ I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . __eou__ The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... __eou__ I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good . __eou__ That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . __eou__ Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings . __eou__
Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . __eou__ That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? __eou__ Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . __eou__ So will I . Thank you . __eou__
Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . __eou__ I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . __eou__
We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? __eou__ This Friday evening ? __eou__ Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . __eou__ Good ! __eou__ What time should I arrive ? __eou__ How about 6:00 ? __eou__ Fine . See you then . __eou__
Hello , this is Mike , Kara . __eou__ Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ? __eou__ Everything is fine , and how are you ? __eou__ Things are going well with me . __eou__ Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday . __eou__ Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home . __eou__ Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something . __eou__ I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together . __eou__
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? __eou__ My choice would always be tea . __eou__ When did you form this hobby ? __eou__ Last year when I visited China . __eou__
John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . __eou__ Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? __eou__ He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ He is in his late thirties . __eou__ Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? __eou__ At two thirty . __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__
Would you like to have some more wine ? __eou__ Sure.thanks . __eou__ Say when . __eou__
May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . __eou__ It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . __eou__
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time ! __eou__
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ Then keep up the good work . __eou__
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! __eou__
Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? __eou__ My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . __eou__ Is it really completely flat ? __eou__ Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__ Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . __eou__ There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__
Who's calling , please ? __eou__ This is John . __eou__ What is it , John ? __eou__ I wonder if I can use your bike . __eou__
Is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . __eou__ Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . __eou__
Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . __eou__ Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! __eou__ OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . __eou__ Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . __eou__ Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . __eou__ Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . __eou__ Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . __eou__ Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . __eou__ Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__ Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . __eou__ Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . __eou__ Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? __eou__ That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . __eou__
Do you know who that tall man is ? __eou__ He's a member of the National Basketball Association . __eou__ Do you know where he comes from ? __eou__ Some people say he's from New York . __eou__
have you ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ that's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ when are you getting married ? __eou__ some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
Is his father a worker ? __eou__ No , he isn't . He's an engineer , the most famous one in our company . __eou__ No wonder his son is so clever . __eou__
How time flies ! __eou__ May and Danny have already grown up . __eou__ I can still remember our first date . __eou__ Look at that big tree over there . __eou__ Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . __eou__ Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight . __eou__ You were dull at that time . __eou__ But you agreed to go out with me at last . __eou__ I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . __eou__
I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . __eou__ That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . __eou__ What do you think our chance are in other events . __eou__ In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . __eou__ We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . __eou__ I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . __eou__ You are very optimistic ! __eou__
Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? __eou__ No . What did it say ? __eou__ There's a garage sale around the corner . __eou__ A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? __eou__ What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? __eou__ I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! __eou__
I'm calling to say good-bye . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . __eou__ Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . __eou__ Goodbye . Thanks again for everything . __eou__
So Janet , do you do any sports ? __eou__ Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . __eou__ Yeah , how often do you go ? __eou__ About three times a week if I can . __eou__ Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? __eou__ Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . __eou__
You must be feeling terrible for Mary . __eou__ Yes , she's been like this for two weeks . __eou__ I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class . __eou__ So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . __eou__
How is grandpa doing recently ? __eou__ Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! __eou__ Maybe I would talk with him someday . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use . __eou__
Come on ! It's time to go ! __eou__ Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? __eou__ Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . __eou__ That won't take long . __eou__ Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . __eou__ Well , I'm not quite ready . __eou__ I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__ You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__ Oh , yes , I would ! __eou__
The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . __eou__ I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . __eou__ Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . __eou__ yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . __eou__ why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . __eou__ it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . __eou__ then SOHO is your ideal work style . __eou__ yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . __eou__ and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . __eou__ absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__ sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? __eou__ yeah , I can find enough online . __eou__ it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . __eou__ thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . __eou__
How are you , Sue ? __eou__ Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s your brother ? __eou__ He is fine . __eou__ He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . __eou__ Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
What is the matter with him ? __eou__ I don't know , what's wrong ? __eou__ I feel he is as cold as charity to me . __eou__ Maybe you should ask him openly . __eou__
Let's take a coffee break . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . __eou__ Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? __eou__ Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__ So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? __eou__ No . I borrowed it to go shopping . __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . __eou__ What kind of dance do you like ? __eou__ I like rumba and tango . __eou__ Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . __eou__ You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . __eou__ OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? __eou__ I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . __eou__ Sounds pleasant . __eou__
Charlotte , have you had your supper ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . __eou__ Why ? Don't you feel well ? __eou__ I ’ m down in spirits . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . __eou__ You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . __eou__ I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . __eou__ You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . __eou__ But I doubt myself . __eou__ Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . __eou__
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? __eou__ Yes , is that you , Allen ? __eou__ Yes , how are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? __eou__ Sure.Thank you very much . __eou__ Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? __eou__ Ok , see you . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? __eou__ Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . __eou__ We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . __eou__ Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . __eou__ Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__ This is gonna be a great barbecue ! __eou__

What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__ doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__ well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__ did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__ no , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__ how about mah-jong ? __eou__ it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! __eou__
Do you surf online regularly , Joe ? __eou__ Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day . __eou__ Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ? __eou__ Millions of things .

I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . __eou__ Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thank you .

hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? __eou__ everything's great . I've just returned from my office . __eou__ your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__ sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__ a virtual office ? __eou__ yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__ what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__ a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__ sounds fun.what else ? __eou__ I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__ oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__ you bet it ! __eou__

How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ No , not really . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . __eou__ You saw a ghost ? When ? __eou__ It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? __eou__ It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? __eou__ It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . __eou__
What do you want for your birthday from your parents ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe a pair of new shoes . __eou__ Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college . __eou__ That's a dandy idea . Thank you for reminding me . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__ Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__ I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__ I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__
I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . __eou__ It's nothing to get upset about . __eou__ I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . __eou__ No . It's out of the question . __eou__
Let me see . How much should I pay for you ? __eou__ Don ’ t think about it ! __eou__ No , this will not do . Let me see . __eou__ You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . __eou__ Good ideas . __eou__

She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny . __eou__

Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ She's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! __eou__ The gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ Thanks . I'm flattered . __eou__ Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . __eou__
My friend Jean is very beautiful . __eou__ What's her figure ? __eou__ Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . __eou__ What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ Dark blue . __eou__
Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? __eou__ Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__ Was it your first time ? __eou__ Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . __eou__
So do you think you can get to the office alone ? __eou__ Sure , I ’ ll catch the train .

I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . __eou__ You ? You are full of hot air . __eou__
Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J __eou__ That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . __eou__ But it's unfair for Jane . __eou__
John , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I stayed up last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you ! __eou__ Will , I'm under a lot of pressure . My manager is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them . __eou__ Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__ I know your feeling . Take it easy and say something to me if you like . __eou__ Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you ! __eou__ Not at all ! __eou__

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Well , speak of the devil . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was just thinking about you the other day . __eou__ You were ? __eou__

Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . __eou__ Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? __eou__ You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . __eou__ Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? __eou__ I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . __eou__ Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__
There are some things I miss .

She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? __eou__ I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . __eou__ The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ Hmm . I hope not . __eou__

I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving .

Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__

What did you think of it ? __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan . __eou__ Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? __eou__ Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ? __eou__ Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? __eou__ Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ? __eou__ I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! __eou__ Yes ! __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ How do you research your books ? __eou__ I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact __eou__ I really like your books .

I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . __eou__
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . __eou__ We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ What do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . __eou__ Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . __eou__
What's the matter with you ? You don't look well . __eou__ Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad . __eou__ Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin . __eou__ Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid . __eou__ Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south . __eou__
Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? __eou__ No . What ? __eou__ He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . __eou__ No . Really , what happened ? __eou__ Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . __eou__ Was he out with the guys from the bank ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . __eou__ Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . __eou__ Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . __eou__ No , she left him last year . __eou__ Oh , really ? Do you know why ? __eou__ Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? __eou__ He lost his wallet and keys . __eou__ Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story __eou__ So then what happened ? __eou__ Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . __eou__ Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__
Well , it was nice talking to you . __eou__ It was nice talking to you too . __eou__ We should really hang out again . __eou__ That would be fun . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I think we should go out to eat . __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ All right , so I'll see you then . __eou__ I'll call you later . __eou__ Okay , I'll talk to you later then . __eou__ See you later . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
How do you like your job here , Linda ? __eou__ It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__ I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__ I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__ Do you have any complaints ? __eou__ No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? __eou__ Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__ That's perfect . I will definitely do well . __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality . __eou__
What is the weather like today ? __eou__ It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . __eou__ And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ I missed today's weather for cast in the radio __eou__ It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery . __eou__ The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport __eou__ That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__

What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I'm going to the movies with a friend . How about you ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ? __eou__ What movie are you going to see ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ? __eou__ There's nothing I can think of . __eou__ So , did you want to go ? __eou__ No , thanks , maybe another time . __eou__ Okay , sounds good . __eou__
Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? __eou__ No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? __eou__ I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? __eou__ He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . __eou__ A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . __eou__
Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . __eou__ Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . __eou__ Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . __eou__ I'd love to try some snacks . __eou__ ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? __eou__ Kebabs and roast squid . __eou__ Can I have a bite ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__ Super ! __eou__
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China . __eou__ I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you . __eou__ We are ready to help you . __eou__ Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ? __eou__ I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again . __eou__ Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit . __eou__ Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing ! __eou__ Goodbye ! __eou__

What's your favorite book ? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind . __eou__ Why do you like it best ? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ Well . I like the Thom Birds best . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I like the writer's language , too . __eou__ If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__
Hello , Mrs . Taylor . I'm here to pick up Diane . __eou__ Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . __eou__
Cheer ! __eou__ Cheer ! __eou__ So what time tomorrow ? __eou__ Half past seven in the morning . __eou__ Where to meet ? __eou__ In the market . __eou__ OK . Bottoms up . __eou__ Bottoms up . __eou__ It's on me . __eou__ Thank you . This place is nice . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how's everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! __eou__ Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . __eou__ An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . __eou__ Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . __eou__ GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? __eou__ Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts __eou__ Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? __eou__ Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! __eou__ No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! __eou__ Umm . . . That's the spirit ! __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . __eou__ Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . __eou__ I don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ I will . __eou__ One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ What's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . __eou__ Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . __eou__
How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__
How is Tom now ? __eou__ He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . __eou__ Let's congratulate him on Sunday . __eou__
Can you believe that Susan got married ? __eou__ Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? __eou__ No . That ’ s what is surprising me . __eou__ You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . __eou__ He ’ s a postman . __eou__ I thought she would marry a fortune . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with John ? __eou__ It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . __eou__
Have you heard about the new iPhone ? __eou__ yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? __eou__ I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . __eou__ if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__ how big is a shuffle iPod ? __eou__ the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__ how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__ I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__ you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__ do you have an iPod ? __eou__ I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . __eou__ why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__ that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . __eou__
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? __eou__ while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__ it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__ I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__ I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__ all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__ perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__ I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__ that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__ you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__
It was great meeting you . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Maybe we can meet again sometime ? __eou__ Of course , but I'll have to go now . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes , I do it a lot.but I don't like doing dishes.what about you , do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ? __eou__ To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning . __eou__ Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ? __eou__ I would rather do the dishes than cook . __eou__ I prefer the absent.the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring . __eou__ let's make a deal . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook . __eou__ Will you do the dishes after the meal ? __eou__ Fair enough ! __eou__
Look , my clothes are wet . __eou__ Mine are wet , too . __eou__ Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . __eou__ She wished good luck to you . __eou__ The Dai people are enthusiastic . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Mary , Pam and I are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . Do you want to come ? __eou__ Can you say it again slowly ? __eou__ Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us . __eou__ Oh , I see . I'll have to sink about it . __eou__ Sink ? __eou__ Oops . I meant , " think " __eou__ Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation . __eou__ I know . __eou__ But give yourself some time . You just got here . __eou__
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Is that your wedding ring ? __eou__ I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . __eou__ Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? __eou__ In June . __eou__ Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? __eou__ Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . __eou__ You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ What kind of watch is it ? __eou__ It's a Tag Heer . __eou__ If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? __eou__ This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . __eou__ That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . __eou__ Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . __eou__
Have you ever made any plan for your future ? __eou__ Of course I have . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible . __eou__ Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever . __eou__ I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs . Right . __eou__
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? __eou__ just after 2 am . __eou__ what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? __eou__ nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . __eou__ really ? What is it ? __eou__ I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__ I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? __eou__ I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c __eou__ just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon ! __eou__ me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! __eou__ thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__ talk to you later . __eou__
I just have to come up for air . I ’ Ve been here for too long a time . __eou__ OK . You ’ d better come back in two hours . __eou__
The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all . __eou__ Maybe you can't be so sure . __eou__ Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious . __eou__ But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth . __eou__ I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . __eou__
What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? __eou__ I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . __eou__ When is your garden at its best ? __eou__ It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ I haven ’ t seen you for several days . __eou__ Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . __eou__ What ’ s he doing ? __eou__ He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . __eou__ He must be happy . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine too . __eou__
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? __eou__ No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? __eou__ Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . __eou__ How much was the ticket ? __eou__ I only paid two dollars for mine . __eou__
Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . __eou__ Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . __eou__ If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . __eou__ OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . __eou__
I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . __eou__ No trouble . I enjoyed helping you . __eou__
Jason , it's your turn . __eou__ I hope I get an easy question like you did . __eou__ You rolled a four . Let's see ... you landed on Foreign Films . __eou__ Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . __eou__ Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ? __eou__ Oh , please ! I have no idea . __eou__ The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English . __eou__
Good morning Mike ! __eou__ Morning Sally !

I can fill in . __eou__ Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ? __eou__ Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much ! __eou__ You're welcome . Good luck , bye ! __eou__ Have a nice day , bye ! __eou__
which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand .

When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . __eou__ So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ? __eou__ Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother . __eou__ And when are they coming to visit us ? __eou__ They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . __eou__
Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . __eou__ Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . __eou__ No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__ Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . __eou__ Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? __eou__ Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . __eou__ It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . __eou__ That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . __eou__ And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . __eou__ But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . __eou__ Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . __eou__ Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . __eou__
Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? __eou__ Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . __eou__ I see.Did they succeed in the end ? __eou__ Of course not.He drowned . __eou__
Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here . __eou__ So what ? Are we going anywhere ? __eou__ Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? __eou__ What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me . __eou__
Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it . __eou__ Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band . __eou__ Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow ! __eou__ Stop making fun of me . __eou__ So find a guy to marry and you can get one ! __eou__ I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring ! __eou__ Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys . __eou__
Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . __eou__ Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__ Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . __eou__ No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! __eou__ Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . __eou__ Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? __eou__ Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . __eou__
I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . __eou__ Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . __eou__
I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping . __eou__ Chicken ! __eou__
Do you like Barry ? __eou__ No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__ I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . __eou__ Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__ What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__
Is my car ready yet ? __eou__ I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? __eou__ It's LF 312 G . __eou__ When did you bring it to us ? __eou__ I bought it here three days ago . __eou__ Ah yes , I remember now . __eou__ Have your mechanics finished yet ? __eou__ No , they're still working on it . Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.Isn ' t that your car ? __eou__ Well , it was my car . __eou__ Didn't you have a crash ? __eou__ That's right . I drove it into a lamp post . Can your mechanics repair it ? __eou__ Well , they're trying to repair it , sir . But to tell you the truth , you need a new car . __eou__
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . __eou__ Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . __eou__
Please come in ! __eou__ Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you . __eou__ Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . __eou__ OK .

It's getting late . __eou__ Yeah , I'd better head for home . __eou__
Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? __eou__ Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . __eou__ Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__ She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__ Do you believe her excuse ? __eou__ Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__ Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . __eou__
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . __eou__
These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __eou__ I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__
Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . __eou__ That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . __eou__ I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . __eou__ OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . __eou__ Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . __eou__ 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . __eou__ I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . __eou__ I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . __eou__ Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . __eou__ Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs __eou__ Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . __eou__
I am really tired of Terry . __eou__ Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . __eou__ He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . __eou__
What shall we do tonight ? __eou__ How about the cinema ? __eou__ That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . __eou__ What would you suggest to see ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know.It depends . __eou__
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! __eou__
Can you lend me fifty bucks ? __eou__ What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough . __eou__ No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ That's my business , not yours . __eou__ True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess . __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . __eou__

We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . __eou__ Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? __eou__ I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . __eou__ Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ? __eou__ I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . __eou__ Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there .

Lets go to this one . __eou__
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . __eou__ And ? __eou__ And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . __eou__ Poor child ! __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__

What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
Hi , Susan ! __eou__ Hi , Lily ! How is everything ? __eou__ Not so well . I've come down with the flu . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . __eou__ Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . __eou__
You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . __eou__ I believe industry is making us wealthier . __eou__ I don ’ t believe that . __eou__ And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . __eou__ I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . __eou__ That ’ s your opinion not mine . __eou__
Hi Bob , how ’ s business ? __eou__ Just okay . __eou__ Okay , enough small talk . Let ’ s get down to business . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me . __eou__ No , I can ’ t accept it . Business is business . __eou__
Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I'm going to be a clerk . __eou__ What does a clerk do ? __eou__ He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . __eou__ I want to be a vet . __eou__ A-what ? __eou__ A vet-a veterinary surgeon . __eou__ Good gracious ! What's that ? __eou__ A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor . __eou__ I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . __eou__
I heard you are busy with your new house now ? __eou__ Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . __eou__ Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ? __eou__ Yeah . This is a big house with a garden . I like it very much . __eou__ But it is far from downtown . Living here is very inconvenient . __eou__ It is very quiet and peaceful . This is what I want . __eou__
Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? __eou__ Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like playing chess . __eou__ Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__ Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . __eou__ Can you tell me why you like it ? __eou__ Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
I hear you are expecting your family . __eou__ Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . __eou__ I didn't know you had a brother . __eou__ Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . __eou__ Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? __eou__ His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . __eou__ Does your brother have just one son ? __eou__ No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . __eou__ I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . __eou__ Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . __eou__ So when are they all coming ? __eou__ My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__ It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . __eou__
Does anyone need a drink ? __eou__ I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? __eou__ It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! __eou__ Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? __eou__ No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? __eou__ No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . __eou__
I've moved . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? __eou__ Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! __eou__ Do you put your feet on your own table ? __eou__ No , I never do that . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I don't want to mark my table , of course . __eou__ Well , will you please put them down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't come back so early . __eou__ I forgot something on the table . __eou__ Oh , you've got a good memory . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . __eou__ I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__
Where can I get the information , Kate ? __eou__ Ask John . He is sure to know about it . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He has a finger in the pie . __eou__
You can't beat me at tennis . __eou__ Do you want to bet ? __eou__
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . __eou__
That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . __eou__ Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? __eou__ Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__ Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . __eou__ There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . __eou__ OK , but they better tag lightly ! __eou__
So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ? __eou__ I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came . __eou__ Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping . __eou__ I love the museums , too . __eou__ But the traffic is pretty bad . __eou__ Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy . __eou__ Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? __eou__ I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! __eou__ OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! __eou__
David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! __eou__ You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? __eou__ Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . __eou__
What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . __eou__ It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . __eou__ Such a thing exists ? __eou__ Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! __eou__ Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . __eou__ You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... __eou__
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? __eou__ what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? __eou__ but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . __eou__ okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__ sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . __eou__ well , we can ask people to make small contributions . __eou__ I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . __eou__ BYOB ? What's that ? __eou__ bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . __eou__ so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . __eou__ maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make __eou__ oh , that sounds like fun ! __eou__
Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ poor Mary ! She really liked him . __eou__ anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ I hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ so do I . __eou__
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ You're dancing so well . __eou__ You dance beautifully too . __eou__ When did you learn to dance ? __eou__ In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ How about tango ? __eou__ Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) __eou__ Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__ I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . __eou__
I ’ d better be going . __eou__ So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but It ’ s already late . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave . __eou__ thank you for wonderful meat . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoy it . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__
Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . __eou__ I sure hope so . __eou__
Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you . __eou__ When ’ s the big day ? __eou__ We ’ re planning a June wedding , but we haven ’ t picked a date yet . __eou__
Tell me about your brother and sister , Sue . __eou__ Well , my sister is a lawyer . __eou__ Really ? Does she live here in Seattle ? __eou__ Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret . __eou__ Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ? __eou__ He's a painter . He's working in Argentina this month . He has an exhibition there . __eou__ What an interesting family ! __eou__
Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? __eou__ Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . __eou__ That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? __eou__ Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . __eou__ We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . __eou__ Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ Ha-ha ! You got me there ! __eou__
Is Water Shrinking Festival official ? __eou__ No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official . __eou__ Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! __eou__ What an idea ! __eou__
Who's the champion in this picture ? __eou__ Let me show you , the one with curly hair . __eou__ He's very handsome , I think . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__ Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__ Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . __eou__ And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! __eou__
What shall I call him ? __eou__ Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . __eou__ What's he doing ? __eou__ He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . __eou__
I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__ I trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__ I'm doing great , thank you . __eou__ So we can get down to business . __eou__
Balista , pull me a ristretto . __eou__ What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? __eou__ It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . __eou__ Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! __eou__ You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? __eou__
I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . __eou__ That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . __eou__ You've take the words out of my mouth . __eou__
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . __eou__ Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__ Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__ Make yourself at home . __eou__ It is such a nice place . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
Who do you think will win the championship ? __eou__ I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . __eou__ There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
Hi , Sue . What's up ? __eou__ Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? __eou__ Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . __eou__ Really ? What's he been doing ? __eou__ You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . __eou__ Are you ? What are you busy with ? __eou__ Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . __eou__
How is everything going with your girlfriend ? __eou__ Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__ It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__ Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? __eou__ No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__ What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__ I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__ I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! __eou__ I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . __eou__ I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? __eou__ Well , do you think I have to ? __eou__ I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . __eou__ Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__ Do many people like tennis ? __eou__ More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
Will you go with us this Sunday ? __eou__ What for ? __eou__ Let's go and play volleyball . __eou__ Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework . __eou__
