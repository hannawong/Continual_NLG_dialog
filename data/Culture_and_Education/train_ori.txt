Guess what came in the mail today ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ My acceptance letter to Yale ! __eou__ Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? __eou__ Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . __eou__ You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . __eou__ When can you do that ? __eou__ Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? __eou__ Sure . What can you choose from ? __eou__ Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . __eou__ What is your major ? __eou__ I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . __eou__ What are the fundamental course ? __eou__ In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . __eou__ Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . __eou__ Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . __eou__
Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . __eou__ You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . __eou__ I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . __eou__ Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . __eou__ You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
How are you doing with your English Language studies ? __eou__ I think I'm making good progress . __eou__ Is it harder than you thought ? __eou__ At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . __eou__
What do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ Study English . __eou__ You mean you like to study English ? Why ? __eou__ It gives me great satisfaction . __eou__ Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . __eou__ I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . __eou__
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . __eou__ Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . __eou__ Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? __eou__ He asked me how long it took me to learn English . __eou__ But , you were born and raised in California ! __eou__ Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__ What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__ You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? __eou__ I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ Are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . __eou__ That's hilarious ! What did he say ? __eou__ He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
How are your Chinese lessons going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . __eou__ Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . __eou__ Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . __eou__ Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . __eou__ Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . __eou__
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ Where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . __eou__ You can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ I really like where I ’ m at now . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ That may be what I ’ m going to do . __eou__ It ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . __eou__
How's your time spent in the United States ? __eou__ Well , pretty good . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? __eou__ Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . __eou__ You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? __eou__ That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__ That's weird . __eou__ And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . __eou__ You really cared about your friend . __eou__ Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ I'm confused . Why did he say that ? __eou__ I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . __eou__ Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . __eou__
You must be new . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I am . __eou__ Have you just started college ? __eou__ No . I transferred here from a different school . __eou__ What school ? __eou__ I transferred here from PCC . __eou__ Do you like it here ? __eou__ I really like it here so far . __eou__ Do you like it better here or at PCC ? __eou__ I like PCC better . __eou__ If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? __eou__ I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree . __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__
Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Are you applying to study or work abroad ? __eou__ I want to study abroad . __eou__ What do you want to study ? __eou__ I hope to study English Literature . __eou__ Have you got your visa yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I have an interview with a visa official today . __eou__ I see.Is it your first interview ? __eou__ No , I ’ Ve already been here for 3 interviews . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
Here's the course description guide . __eou__ What do I do with it ? __eou__ Do you want me to help you ? __eou__ Please . __eou__ Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them . __eou__ So I don't have to worry about them . __eou__ You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... __eou__ I'll take home economics . __eou__ Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . __eou__
Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ That makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ Yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
You got a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it to me . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been accepted ! __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I ’ m serious . __eou__ Good for you ! __eou__ NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . __eou__ I ’ m so proud of you . __eou__ Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . __eou__
How long have you been in America ? __eou__ For more than five years . __eou__ Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? __eou__ It's no picnic . __eou__
Does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ No . It's all Greek to me . __eou__ She's speaking French , not Greek . __eou__ I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . __eou__ I wish you the best of luck . __eou__
Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . __eou__ Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__ Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . __eou__ Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . __eou__ Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
Are there many idioms in English ? __eou__ There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . __eou__ Can you give us an example ? __eou__ I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . __eou__ What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? __eou__ That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . __eou__ This is interesting , Ms.Parker . __eou__
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__
There ’ s a letter here for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ What ’ s the letter about ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from NYU . __eou__ Tell me what it says ! __eou__ I didn ’ t get in . __eou__ You ’ re lying . __eou__ I ’ m not lying . __eou__ Are you upset ? __eou__ I had high hopes for NYU . __eou__ I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__ Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . __eou__
You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ Is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Do you want to know something about the American character ? __eou__ I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . __eou__
You ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Will this be your first year ? __eou__ No , I transferred here . __eou__ What school did you come from ? __eou__ I transferred from PCC . __eou__ Why ’ d you transfer here ? __eou__ I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Is PCC a good school ? __eou__ PCC is great ! __eou__ I hope you enjoy it here . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
You got a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it to me . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s from NYU . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ I didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__ You can ’ t be serious ! __eou__ I ’ m serious . __eou__ Are you all right ? __eou__ NYU was my first choice . __eou__ I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . __eou__
You ready ? __eou__ Am I ready for what ? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . __eou__ You ’ re not nervous , are you ? __eou__ I ’ m very nervous . __eou__ Why are you nervous ? __eou__ I ’ m not going to know anybody there . __eou__ That ’ s not a problem . __eou__ That makes me nervous . __eou__ It ’ s fun meeting new people . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it that way . __eou__
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . __eou__ Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? __eou__ What's your method of learning ? __eou__ Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other . __eou__ That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__
OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? __eou__ The brain ! __eou__ That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? __eou__ The heart ! __eou__ Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? __eou__ The stomach and intestines ! __eou__ Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? __eou__ Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! __eou__ Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . __eou__ So what do these organs do , teacher ? __eou__ Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . __eou__
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? __eou__ On and off , for quite a few years . __eou__
You ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ Yes , I am new . __eou__ Is this your first semester ? __eou__ I just transferred from another school . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I came here from PCC . __eou__ Do you like it here so far ? __eou__ I am really enjoying it here so far . __eou__ Which is better , here or PCC ? __eou__ I think PCC is a lot better than here . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? __eou__ I graduated and now want to get a BA . __eou__
Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__ Are you applying to study or work abroad ? __eou__ I want to study abroad . __eou__ What do you want to study ? __eou__ I hope to study English literature . __eou__ Have you got your visa yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . __eou__ I see . Is it your first interview ? __eou__ No , I've already been to here for three interviews . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I was denied a visa ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Like most students . I want to work in America after graduation . __eou__ I see . Well , good luck ! __eou__
Here ’ s a letter for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ Who ’ s the letter from ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance . __eou__ Read it ! __eou__ UCLA accepted me ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I ’ m not joking . I got accepted ! __eou__ I ’ m so happy for you ! __eou__ UCLA was my second choice , but I ’ m happy knowing I ’ Ve been accepted . __eou__ I am really proud of you . __eou__ You have no idea how proud I am of myself . __eou__
Do you know where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I don ’ t have the slightest clue . __eou__ What school would you like to go to ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . __eou__ You honestly have no idea ? __eou__ PCC is perfectly fine for me . __eou__ You might as well stay here . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . __eou__ PCC is a wonderful institution . __eou__ You have a point . __eou__ So , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . __eou__
Eric , how long will you be in China ? __eou__ I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? __eou__ How about this sunday ? __eou__ Ok , cool . __eou__ Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
I have a real problem when I meet people . __eou__ What is it ? Maybe I can help . __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ That sounds easy enough . __eou__ Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__
You received a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it here . __eou__ Who ’ s the letter from ? __eou__ I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . __eou__ I want to know what it says . __eou__ They didn ’ t accept me . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ It ’ s the truth . __eou__ Are you okay ? __eou__ I really wanted to get into NYU . __eou__ I am really sorry to hear that . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . __eou__
I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! __eou__ Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . __eou__ No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . __eou__ Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ Good idea . That might help . __eou__
My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . __eou__ What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__ The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . __eou__ Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . __eou__ That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . __eou__ Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . __eou__ That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__ I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? __eou__ Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? __eou__ Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! __eou__ Did you bow back ? __eou__ No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . __eou__ Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . __eou__ But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? __eou__ Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . __eou__ Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? __eou__ I think it's highly possible , yes . __eou__ The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . __eou__ That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . __eou__ That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . __eou__
