I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does .
