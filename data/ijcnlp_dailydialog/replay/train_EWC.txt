I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient .

I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much .

I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra .  __sou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately .
