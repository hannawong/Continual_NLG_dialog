My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . __eou__ What a great idea !

And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . __eou__ Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English .  __sou__ That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ?
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say .

Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .  __sou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language .
