Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? __eou__ Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . __eou__ Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? __eou__ I think that we should have just the sub-committee . __eou__ OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ?  __sou__ No , I need directions , please .
How can I help you , sir ? __eou__ I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . __eou__ Sorry , could you tell me your name ? __eou__ I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . __eou__ Do you have an appointment ? __eou__ Yes , I did it yesterday .

I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . __eou__ Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . __eou__ Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .  __sou__ Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately .
That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . __eou__ Yes , I have an overall understanding . __eou__ When we have the final results , we will call you . __eou__ Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? __eou__ If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . __eou__ But if I don't pass , will you call me ? __eou__ I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .  __sou__ Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? __eou__ 15 dollars per dozen __eou__ Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . __eou__ However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . __eou__ If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__ I hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__ We'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__ What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__ Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ?  __sou__ About 300 dozens .
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__ To visit our supplier ?  __sou__ Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers .
Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? __eou__ It is because of the quality . __eou__ Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__ I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__ Yes , I do .  __sou__ The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard .
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ?  __sou__ sure . What do you need ?
Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Can ’ t complain . And you ? __eou__ Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__ Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .  __sou__ Great .

Have a seat please . __eou__ I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell . __eou__ Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . __eou__ Really ? Since I have to go back to England within the next few months , I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible . __eou__ Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ? __eou__ Flat C . 15 / F , Tong House , Tai Koo Shing . __eou__ What is the square footage of your property ? How many bedrooms and living rooms ? __eou__ Its gross area is approximately nine hundred square feet . There's one living room , one dining room , one master bedroom and two other bedrooms . __eou__ What is the orientation and view ? __eou__ It faces south with a hillside view . __eou__ The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house . __eou__ I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars . __eou__ May I have your name and contact number , Sir ? __eou__ Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 .

Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat .  __sou__ Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied .
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . __eou__ I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__ And it takes up all the news . __eou__ The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__ It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . __eou__ Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .  __sou__ I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ I will be voting tomorrow . __eou__ What ’ s your polling place ? __eou__ My polling place is at the park up the street .  __sou__ Oh , yeah ?
Were you able to get a look at the suspect's face ? __eou__ Yes . I know exactly what he looks like . __eou__ I must ask you to pick him out of a line-up . __eou__ That won't be a problem . __eou__ Look closely at the five men in this line-up . __eou__ I am looking . __eou__ Do you see the suspect ? __eou__ Yes . He's in the line-up . __eou__ What number is the suspect ? __eou__ Number four .  __sou__ Thank you for all your help .

Are you going to vote ? __eou__ I am so excited to be voting . __eou__ Do you know who you ’ re going to vote for ? __eou__ I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . __eou__ What ’ s so great about him ? __eou__ I feel that he is very intelligent . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Yes , and I agree with all his policies .  __sou__ That ’ s good to hear .
How may I help you ? __eou__ I would like you to be my lawyer . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I ’ m going on trial . __eou__ What is your trial about ? __eou__ It ’ s a felony charge .  __sou__ I ’ d be glad to help .
Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . __eou__ I certainly have . __eou__ When did this happen ? __eou__ About two hours ago . __eou__ Why didn't you report it before ? __eou__ I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . __eou__ Please tell me exactly what happened . __eou__ I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . __eou__ That wasn't very wise , sir . __eou__ I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . __eou__ You should never open a door without looking to see who it is . __eou__ Yes , I know . I regret it very much . __eou__ What happened ?  __sou__ Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me .

Is everything all right ? __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Someone just robbed me . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ This guy just robbed me right on the street .  __sou__ He didn't hurt you , did he ?
I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__ What would you like to speak to me about ?  __sou__ I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .
Did you hear about the robbery ? __eou__ Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .  __sou__ Are you serious ?
Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? __eou__ I ’ m so happy about that . __eou__ Did you vote for him ? __eou__ I sure did . How about you ? __eou__ I voted for him .  __sou__ I have complete confidence in our new President .

You can get them on-line .
How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__ Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__ Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . __eou__ What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__ This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?  __sou__ They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ I will be voting tomorrow . __eou__ What ’ s your polling place ?  __sou__ My polling place is at the park up the street .
You ’ re all set to leave . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it .  __sou__ What are your plans ?
You say he was around average hight . __eou__ Yeah , that's right , around five nine five ten . __eou__ Weight ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side . __eou__ Any karks on his face ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Glasses ? __eou__ No . __eou__ what about his hair ? __eou__ Black or dark brown . __eou__ Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__ Straight , I think , and about average length .  __sou__ Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing .
Are you going somewhere ?  __sou__ I ’ m on my way to work .
Did you hear who won the election ? __eou__ No , who was it ? __eou__ McCain is our new President . __eou__ You ’ re a liar ! __eou__ I ’ m not happy about it , either . __eou__ Who voted for him ? __eou__ I guess the people wanted him as our new leader . __eou__ That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . __eou__ I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . __eou__ What could be worse than what you just told me ?  __sou__ I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected .
Are you going to vote ? __eou__ I am . Are you ? __eou__ Yes , and for the first time . __eou__ Is that right ?  __sou__ I don ’ t know how to vote .
Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? __eou__ Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__ Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? __eou__ I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . __eou__ I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? __eou__ It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ?  __sou__ I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions .
How can I help you this afternoon ? __eou__ I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . __eou__ Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . __eou__ Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . __eou__ You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? __eou__ I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . __eou__ Thank you . And you require ... __eou__ 800 RIB , please .  __sou__ Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please .
How ’ s it going ? __eou__ I ’ m great . Thanks . __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to know if I have any fees to pay . __eou__ Actually , you do owe some fees . __eou__ How much do I owe ? __eou__ Your fees total $ 235.13 . __eou__ That ’ s crazy ! __eou__ You need to pay these fees soon . __eou__ Can I do that right now ?  __sou__ Will you be paying with cash or check ?
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks . __eou__ All right . How much do you need ? __eou__ One thousand U . S . dollars .  __sou__ One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ?
I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . __eou__ I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__ Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission .  __sou__ Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ?
I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? __eou__ For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__ That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? __eou__ Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 .  __sou__ So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ?  __sou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough .
Is this the Law Firm of A & B ? __eou__ Yes , sir.how can I help you ? __eou__ I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance . __eou__ You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens . __eou__ Is she available ?  __sou__ One moment , please , and I will connect your call .
Hello , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__ Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest .  __sou__ You mean there is really not that much of a difference .
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__ That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__ Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__ Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Carton ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__ That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment .  __sou__ No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?
Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ?  __sou__ It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently .
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ?  __sou__ Are you going to make an offer today ?
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .  __sou__ That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
How can I help you today ? __eou__ I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? __eou__ Have you got some ID and your cash card ? __eou__ Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too .  __sou__ How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ?
Good morning , Sir . __eou__ Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ?  __sou__ Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ?
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__ I don't think we can . __eou__ Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ By the middle of October , I think . __eou__ That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ I understand .  __sou__ Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season .

The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us .  __sou__ All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .
I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system .  __sou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess .
Good morning , Sir . __eou__ Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? __eou__ Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? __eou__ 10,000 Japanese yen . __eou__ OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ?  __sou__ Fixed .
Hi , I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card . __eou__ Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm afraid I don't .
