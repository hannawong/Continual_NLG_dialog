My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . __eou__ Well , it's a good thing for you . __eou__ Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . __eou__ So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? __eou__ I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . __eou__ junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat .  __sou__ But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous .
What is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .  __sou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
Why is there no water coming out when you turn on the faucet ? __eou__ Not even a single drop ? __eou__ Well , it's just drip drip drip . But that's not water . __eou__ I don't know . Since yesterday morning , the water pressure has dropped to a little more than a drip . __eou__ Did you call the apartment management yet ? __eou__ Yeah , I called and they said they'd send someone over . __eou__ How long ago did you do that ?  __sou__ It was 36 hours ago .

What were you thinking you should offer ? __eou__ I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more . __eou__ It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? __eou__ I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer . __eou__ Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer . __eou__ Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ? __eou__ It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer .  __sou__ Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ?

In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__ Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__ Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__ Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__ What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar .  __sou__ Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .
I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you . __eou__ I can help you . What location are you looking for ? __eou__ I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia . __eou__ Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size ? __eou__ We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom . __eou__ Is living in a particular school district important to you ? __eou__ No , we don ’ t really care because they are all pretty good around here .  __sou__ Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ?
Did you check before you left the shop ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole . __eou__ Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .  __sou__ Thank you very much .
Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I am going to the Capital Hotel . __eou__ Get in . I will take you there . __eou__ About how much it will cost ? __eou__ $ 50 .  __sou__ On the meter ?
So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . __eou__ That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . __eou__ Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .  __sou__ Did you buy new cupboards too ?
You're going to have coffee , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes . I could use a cup of coffee . __eou__ Are you going to have anything to eat ? __eou__ French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ?  __sou__ I'll have that too .
This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? __eou__ What are you unhappy with ? __eou__ I want to have a different color carpet . __eou__ If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet . __eou__ Would it cost a lot more ?  __sou__ It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard .

And you should speak only English to me , too . __eou__ Okay , mom . __eou__ Right . That's good . __eou__ It will be hard at first , but I think I can do it . __eou__ I know you can do it . __eou__ I will do my best .  __sou__ That is great . All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do .
Hello ! __eou__ Hello , Debbie . This is Donald . __eou__ Oh , hi , Donald . __eou__ What happened yesterday ?
